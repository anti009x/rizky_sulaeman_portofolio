    "content": "\n\nThespeed of lightinvacuum, commonly denotedc, is a universalphysical constantthat is exactly equal to 299,792,458 metres per second (approximately 300,000 kilometres per second; 186,000 miles per second; 671 million miles per hour). It is exact because, by a 1983 international agreement, ametreis defined as the length of the path travelled bylightin vacuum during a time interval of1⁄299792458second. According to thespecial theory of relativity,cis the upper limit for the speed at which conventionalmatterorenergy(and thus anysignalcarryinginformation) can travel throughspace.[2][3][4]\n\nAll forms ofelectromagnetic radiation, includingvisible light, travel at the speed of light. For many practical purposes, light and other electromagnetic waves will appear to propagate instantaneously, but for long distances and very sensitive measurements, their finite speed has noticeable effects. Muchstarlightviewed onEarthis from the distant past, allowing humans to study the history of the universe by viewing distant objects. Whencommunicatingwith distantspace probes, it can take minutes to hours for signals to travel. Incomputing, the speed of light fixes the ultimate minimumcommunication delay. The speed of light can be used intime of flightmeasurements to measure large distances to extremely high precision.\n\nOle Rømerfirstdemonstrated in 1676that light does not travel instantaneously by studying the apparent motion ofJupiter's moonIo. Progressively more accurate measurements of its speed came over the following centuries. In apaperpublished in 1865,James Clerk Maxwellproposed that light was anelectromagnetic waveand, therefore, travelled at speedc.[5]In 1905,Albert Einsteinpostulated that the speed of lightcwith respect to anyinertial frame of referenceis a constant and is independent of the motion of the light source.[6]He explored the consequences of that postulate by deriving thetheory of relativityand, in doing so, showed that the parameterchad relevance outside of the context of light and electromagnetism.\n\nMassless particlesandfieldperturbations, such asgravitational waves, also travel at speedcin vacuum. Such particles and waves travel atcregardless of the motion of the source or the inertial reference frame of theobserver. Particles with nonzerorest masscan be accelerated to approachcbut can never reach it, regardless of the frame of reference in which their speed is measured. In thetheory of relativity,cinterrelatesspace and timeand appears in the famousmass–energy equivalence,E=mc2.[7]\n\nIn some cases, objects or waves may appear to travelfaster than light(e.g.,phase velocitiesof waves,the appearance of certain high-speed astronomical objects, and particularquantum effects). Theexpansion of the universeis understood to exceed the speed of light beyonda certain boundary.\n\nThe speed at which light propagates throughtransparent materials, such as glass or air, is less thanc; similarly, the speed ofelectromagnetic wavesin wire cables is slower thanc. The ratio betweencand the speedvat which light travels in a material is called therefractive indexnof the material (n=⁠c/v⁠). For example, for visible light, the refractive index of glass is typically around 1.5, meaning that light in glass travels at⁠c/1.5⁠≈200000km/s (124000mi/s); therefractive index of airfor visible light is about 1.0003, so the speed of light in air is about 90 km/s (56 mi/s) slower thanc.\n\nThe speed of light in vacuum is usually denoted by a lowercasec. The origin of the letter choice is unclear, with guesses including \"c\" for \"constant\" or the Latinceleritas(meaning 'swiftness, celerity').[8]The \"c\" was used for \"celerity\" meaning a velocity in books byLeonhard Eulerand others, but this velocity was not specifically for light;Isaac Asimovwrote a popular science article,. \"C for Celeritas\", but did not explain the origin.[9]In 1856,Wilhelm Eduard WeberandRudolf Kohlrauschhad usedcfor a different constant that was later shown to equal√2times the speed of light in vacuum. Historically, the symbolVwas used as an alternative symbol for the speed of light, introduced byJames Clerk Maxwellin 1865. In 1903,Max Abrahamusedcwith its modern meaning in a widely read textbook on electromagnetism.EinsteinusedVin hisoriginal German-language paperson special relativity in 1905, but in 1907 he switched toc, which by then had become the standard symbol for the speed of light.[10][8]\n\nSometimescis used for the speed of waves in any material medium, andc0for the speed of light in vacuum.[11]This subscripted notation, which is endorsed in official SI literature,[12]has the same form as related electromagnetic constants: namely,μ0for thevacuum permeabilityor magnetic constant,ε0for thevacuum permittivityor electric constant, andZ0for theimpedance of free space. This article usescexclusively for the speed of light in vacuum.\n\nSince 1983, the constantchas been defined in theInternational System of Units(SI) asexactly299792458m/s; this relationship is used to define the metre as exactly the distance that light travels in vacuum in1⁄299792458of a second. The second is, in turn, defined to be the length of time occupied by9192631770cyclesof the radiation emitted by acaesium-133atomin a transition between two specifiedenergy states.[13]By using the value ofc, as well as an accurate measurement of the second, one can  establish a standard for the metre.[14]\n\nThe particular value chosen for the speed of light provided  a more accurate definition of the metre that still agreed as much as possible with the definition used before 1983.[13][15]\n\nAs adimensional physical constant, the numerical value ofcis different for different unit systems. For example, inimperial units, the speed of light is approximately186282miles per second,[Note 3]or roughly 1footper nanosecond.[Note 4][16][17]\n\nIn branches of physics in whichcappears often, such as in relativity, it is common to use systems ofnatural unitsof measurement or thegeometrized unit systemwherec= 1.[18][19]Using these units,cdoes not appear explicitly because multiplication or division by1 does not affect the result. Its unit oflight-secondper second is still relevant, even if omitted.\n\nThe speed at which light waves propagate in vacuum is independent both of the motion of the wave source and of theinertial frame of referenceof the observer.[Note 5]This invariance of the speed of light was postulated by Einstein in 1905,[6]after being motivated byMaxwell's theory of electromagnetismand the lack of evidence for motion against theluminiferous aether.[20]It has since been consistently confirmed by many experiments.[Note 6]It is only possible to verify experimentally that the two-way speed of light (for example, from a source to a mirror and back again) is frame-independent, because it is impossible to measure theone-way speed of light(for example, from a source to a distant detector) without some convention as to how clocks at the source and at the detector should be synchronized.[21][22]\n\nBy adoptingEinstein synchronizationfor the clocks, the one-way speed of light becomes equal to the two-way speed of light by definition.[21][22]Thespecial theory of relativityexplores the consequences of this invariance ofcwith the assumption that the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference.[23][24]One consequence is thatcis the speed at which all massless particles and waves, including light, must travel in vacuum.[25][Note 7]\n\nSpecial relativity has many counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications.[27]These include theequivalence of mass and energy(E=mc2),length contraction(moving objects shorten),[Note 8]andtime dilation(moving clocks run more slowly). The factorγby which lengths contract and times dilate is known as theLorentz factorand is given byγ= (1 −v2/c2)−1/2, wherevis the speed of the object. The difference ofγfrom1 is negligible for speeds much slower thanc, such as most everyday speeds – in which case special relativity is closely approximated byGalilean relativity– but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity asvapproachesc. For example, a time dilation factor ofγ= 2 occurs at a relative velocity of 86.6% of the speed of light (v= 0.866c). Similarly, a time dilation factor ofγ= 10 occurs at 99.5% the speed of light (v= 0.995c).\n\nThe results of special relativity can be summarized by treating space and time as a unified structure known asspacetime(withcrelating the units of space and time), and requiring that physical theories satisfy a specialsymmetrycalledLorentz invariance, whose mathematical formulation contains the parameterc.[30]Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories, such asquantum electrodynamics,quantum chromodynamics, theStandard Modelofparticle physics, andgeneral relativity. As such, the parametercis ubiquitous in modern physics, appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light. For example, general relativity predicts thatcis also thespeed of gravityand ofgravitational waves,[31]and observations of gravitational waves have been consistent with this prediction.[32]Innon-inertial framesof reference (gravitationally curved spacetime oraccelerated reference frames), thelocalspeed of light is constant and equal toc, but the speed of light can differ fromcwhen measured from a remote frame of reference, depending on how measurements are extrapolated to the region.[33]\n\nIt is generally assumed that fundamental constants such aschave the same value throughout spacetime, meaning that they do not depend on location and do not vary with time. However, it has been suggested in various theories that thespeed of light may have changed over time.[34][35]No conclusive evidence for such changes has been found, but they remain the subject of ongoing research.[36][37]\n\nIt is generally assumed that the two-way speed of light isisotropic, meaning that it has the same value regardless of the direction in which it is measured. Observations of the emissions from nuclearenergy levelsas a function of the orientation of the emittingnucleiin a magnetic field (seeHughes–Drever experiment), and of rotatingoptical resonators(seeResonator experiments) have put stringent limits on the possible two-wayanisotropy.[38][39]\n\nAccording to special relativity, the energy of an object withrest massmand speedvis given byγmc2, whereγis the Lorentz factor defined above. Whenvis zero,γis equal to one, giving rise to the famousE=mc2formula for mass–energy equivalence. Theγfactor approaches infinity asvapproachesc, and it would take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate an object with mass to the speed of light. The speed of light is the upper limit for the speeds of objects with positive rest mass, and individual photons cannot travel faster than the speed of light.[40]This is experimentally established in manytests of relativistic energy and momentum.[41]\n\nMore generally, it is impossible for signals or energy to travel faster thanc. One argument for this follows from the counter-intuitive implication of special relativity known as therelativity of simultaneity. If the spatial distance between two events A and B is greater than the time interval between them multiplied bycthen there are frames of reference in which A precedes B, others in which B precedes A, and others in which they are simultaneous. As a result, if something were travelling faster thancrelative to an inertial frame of reference, it would be travelling backwards in time relative to another frame, andcausalitywould be violated.[Note 9][44]In such a frame of reference, an \"effect\" could be observed before its \"cause\". Such a violation of causality has never been recorded,[22]and would lead toparadoxessuch as thetachyonic antitelephone.[45]\n\nThere are situations in which it may seem that matter, energy, or information-carrying signal travels at speeds greater thanc, but they do not. For example, as is discussed in thepropagation of light in a mediumsection below, many wave velocities can exceedc. Thephase velocityofX-raysthrough most glasses can routinely exceedc,[46]but phase velocity does not determine the velocity at which waves convey information.[47]\n\nIf a laser beam is swept quickly across a distant object, the spot of light can move faster thanc, although the initial movement of the spot is delayed because of the time it takes light to get to the distant object at the speedc. However, the only physical entities that are moving are the laser and its emitted light, which travels at the speedcfrom the laser to the various positions of the spot. Similarly, a shadow projected onto a distant object can be made to move faster thanc, after a delay in time.[48]In neither case does any matter, energy, or information travel faster than light.[49]\n\nThe rate of change in the distance between two objects in a frame of reference with respect to which both are moving (theirclosing speed) may have a value in excess ofc. However, this does not represent the speed of any single object as measured in a single inertial frame.[49]\n\nCertain quantum effects appear to be transmitted instantaneously and therefore faster thanc, as in theEPR paradox. An example involves thequantum statesof two particles that can beentangled. Until either of the particles is observed, they exist in asuperpositionof two quantum states. If the particles are separated and one particle's quantum state is observed, the other particle's quantum state is determined instantaneously. However, it is impossible to control which quantum state the first particle will take on when it is observed, so information cannot be transmitted in this manner.[49][50]\n\nAnother quantum effect that predicts the occurrence of faster-than-light speeds is called theHartman effect: under certain conditions the time needed for avirtual particletotunnelthrough a barrier is constant, regardless of the thickness of the barrier.[51][52]This could result in a virtual particle crossing a large gap faster than light. However, no information can be sent using this effect.[53]\n\nSo-calledsuperluminal motionis seen in certain astronomical objects,[54]such as therelativistic jetsofradio galaxiesandquasars. However, these jets are not moving at speeds in excess of the speed of light: the apparent superluminal motion is aprojectioneffect caused by objects moving near the speed of light and approaching Earth at a small angle to the line of sight: since the light which was emitted when the jet was farther away took longer to reach the Earth, the time between two successive observations corresponds to a longer time between the instants at which the light rays were emitted.[55]\n\nA 2011 experiment whereneutrinos were observed to travel faster than lightturned out to be due to experimental error.[56][57]\n\nIn models of theexpanding universe, the farther galaxies are from each other, the faster they drift apart. For example, galaxies far away from Earth are inferred to be moving away from the Earth with speeds proportional to their distances. Beyond a boundary called theHubble sphere, the rate at which their distance from Earth increases becomes greater than the speed of light.[58]These recession rates, defined as the increase inproper distancepercosmological time, are not velocities in a relativistic sense. Faster-than-light cosmological recession speeds are only acoordinateartifact.\n\nInclassical physics, light is described as a type ofelectromagnetic wave. The classical behaviour of theelectromagnetic fieldis described byMaxwell's equations, which predict that the speedcwith which electromagnetic waves (such as light) propagate in vacuum is related to the distributed capacitance and inductance of vacuum, otherwise respectively known as theelectric constantε0and themagnetic constantμ0, by the equation[59]\n\nIn modernquantum physics, the electromagnetic field is described by the theory ofquantum electrodynamics(QED). In this theory, light is described by the fundamental excitations (or quanta) of the electromagnetic field, calledphotons. In QED, photons aremassless particlesand thus, according to special relativity, they travel at the speed of light in vacuum.[25]\n\nExtensions of QED in which the photon has a mass have been considered. In such a theory, its speed would depend on its frequency, and the invariant speedcof special relativity would then be the upper limit of the speed of light in vacuum.[33]No variation of the speed of light with frequency has been observed in rigorous testing, putting stringent limits on the mass of the photon.[60]The limit obtained depends on the model used: if the massive photon is described byProca theory,[61]the experimental upper bound for its mass is about 10−57grams;[62]if photon mass is generated by aHiggs mechanism, the experimental upper limit is less sharp,m≤10−14eV/c2(roughly 2 × 10−47g).[61]\n\nAnother reason for the speed of light to vary with its frequency would be the failure of special relativity to apply to arbitrarily small scales, as predicted by some proposed theories ofquantum gravity. In 2009, the observation ofgamma-ray burstGRB 090510found no evidence for a dependence of photon speed on energy, supporting tight constraints in specific models of spacetime quantization on how this speed is affected by photon energy for energies approaching thePlanck scale.[63]\n\nIn a medium, light usually does not propagate at a speed equal toc; further, different types of light wave will travel at different speeds. The speed at which the individual crests and troughs of aplane wave(a wave filling the whole space, with only onefrequency) propagate is called thephase velocityvp. A physical signal with a finite extent (a pulse of light) travels at a different speed. The overallenvelopeof the pulse travels at thegroup velocityvg, and its earliest part travels at thefront velocityvf.[64]\n\nThe phase velocity is important in determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented in terms of arefractive index. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio ofcto the phase velocityvpin the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity,polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. Therefractive index of airis approximately 1.0003.[65]Denser media, such aswater,[66]glass,[67]anddiamond,[68]have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light.\n\nIn exotic materials likeBose–Einstein condensatesnearabsolute zero, the effective speed of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-cspeeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light \"slowing\" in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a \"complete standstill\" by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the elementrubidium. The popular description of light being \"stopped\" in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had \"stopped\", it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which \"slow\" the speed of light.[69]\n\nIn transparent materials, the refractive index generally is greater than 1, meaning that the phase velocity is less thanc. In other materials, it is possible for the refractive index to become smaller than1 for some frequencies; in some exotic materials it is even possible for the index of refraction to become negative.[70]The requirement that causality is not violated implies that thereal and imaginary partsof thedielectric constantof any material, corresponding respectively to the index of refraction and to theattenuation coefficient, are linked by theKramers–Kronig relations.[71][72]In practical terms, this means that in a material with refractive index less than 1, the wave will be absorbed quickly.[73]\n\nA pulse with different group and phase velocities (which occurs if the phase velocity is not the same for all the frequencies of the pulse) smears out over time, a process known asdispersion. Certain materials have an exceptionally low (or even zero) group velocity for light waves, a phenomenon calledslow light.[74]The opposite, group velocities exceedingc, was proposed theoretically in 1993 and achieved experimentally in 2000.[75]It should even be possible for the group velocity to become infinite or negative, with pulses travelling instantaneously or backwards in time.[64]\n\nNone of these options allow information to be transmitted faster thanc. It is impossible to transmit information with a light pulse any faster than the speed of the earliest part of the pulse (the front velocity). It can be shown that this is (under certain assumptions) always equal toc.[64]\n\nIt is possible for a particle to travel through a medium faster than the phase velocity of light in that medium (but still slower thanc). When acharged particledoes that in adielectricmaterial, the electromagnetic equivalent of ashock wave, known asCherenkov radiation, is emitted.[76]\n\nThe speed of light is of relevance totelecommunications: the one-way andround-trip delay timeare greater than zero. This applies from small to astronomical scales. On the other hand, some techniques depend on the finite speed of light, for example in distance measurements.\n\nIncomputers, the speed of light imposes a limit on how quickly data can be sent betweenprocessors. If a processor operates at 1gigahertz, a signal can travel only a maximum of about 30 centimetres (1 ft) in a single clock cycle – in practice, this distance is even shorter since theprinted circuit boardrefracts and slows down signals. Processors must therefore be placed close to each other, as well asmemorychips, to minimize communication latencies, and care must be exercised when routing wires between them to ensuresignal integrity. If clock frequencies continue to increase, the speed of light may eventually become a limiting factor for the internal design of singlechips.[77][78]\n\nGiven that the equatorial circumference of the Earth is about40075kmand thatcis about300000km/s, the theoretical shortest time for a piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds. When light is traveling inoptical fibre(atransparent material) the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in optical fibre, depending on its refractive indexn.[Note 10]Straight lines are rare in global communications and the travel time increases when signals pass through electronic switches or signal regenerators.[80]\n\nAlthough this distance is largely irrelevant for most applications, latency becomes important in fields such ashigh-frequency trading, where traders seek to gain minute advantages by delivering their trades to exchanges fractions of a second ahead of other traders. For example, traders have been switching tomicrowavecommunications between trading hubs, because of the advantage which radio waves travelling at near to the speed of light through air have over comparatively slowerfibre opticsignals.[81][82]\n\nSimilarly, communications between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There is a brief delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for communications betweenground controlandApollo 8when it became the first crewed spacecraft to orbit theMoon: for every question, the ground control station had to wait at least three seconds for the answer to arrive.[83]\n\nThe communications delay between Earth andMarscan vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot on the surface of Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until approximately4–24 minuteslater. It would then take a further4–24 minutesfor commands to travel from Earth to Mars.[84][85]\n\nReceiving light and other signals from distant astronomical sources takes much longer. For example, it takes 13 billion (13×109) years for light to travel to Earth from the faraway galaxies viewed in theHubble Ultra-Deep Fieldimages.[86][87]Those photographs, taken today, capture images of the galaxies as they appeared 13 billion years ago, when the universe was less than a billion years old.[86]The fact that more distant objects appear to be younger, due to the finite speed of light, allows astronomers to infer theevolution of stars,of galaxies, andof the universeitself.[88]\n\nAstronomical distances are sometimes expressed inlight-years, especially inpopular sciencepublications and media.[89]A light-year is the distance light travels in oneJulian year, around 9461 billion kilometres, 5879 billion miles, or 0.3066parsecs. In round figures, a light year is nearly 10 trillion kilometres or nearly 6 trillion miles.Proxima Centauri, the closest star to Earth after the Sun, is around 4.2 light-years away.[90]\n\nRadarsystems measure the distance to a target by the time it takes a radio-wave pulse to return to the radar antenna after being reflected by the target: the distance to the target is half the round-triptransit timemultiplied by the speed of light. AGlobal Positioning System(GPS) receiver measures its distance toGPS satellitesbased on how long it takes for a radio signal to arrive from each satellite, and from these distances calculates the receiver's position. Because light travels about300000kilometres(186000miles) in one second, these measurements of small fractions of a second must be very precise. TheLunar Laser Ranging experiment,radar astronomyand theDeep Space Networkdetermine distances to the Moon,[91]planets[92]and spacecraft,[93]respectively, by measuring round-trip transit times.\n\nThere are different ways to determine the value ofc. One way is to measure the actual speed at which light waves propagate, which can be done in various astronomical and Earth-based setups. It is also possible to determinecfrom other physical laws where it appears, for example, by determining the values of the electromagnetic constantsε0andμ0and using their relation toc. Historically, the most accurate results have been obtained by separately determining the frequency and wavelength of a light beam, with their product equallingc. This is described in more detail in the\"Interferometry\" sectionbelow.\n\nIn 1983 the metre was defined as \"the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of1⁄299792458of a second\",[94]fixing the value of the speed of light at299792458m/sby definition, asdescribed below. Consequently, accurate measurements of the speed of light yield an accurate realization of the metre rather than an accurate value ofc.\n\nOuter spaceis a convenient setting for measuring the speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfectvacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in theSolar System, such as theradiusof the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units.\n\nOle Rømerused an astronomical measurement to makethe first quantitative estimate of the speed of lightin the year 1676.[95][96]When measured from Earth, the periods of moons orbiting a distant planet are shorter when the Earth is approaching the planet than when the Earth is receding from it. The difference is small, but the cumulative time becomes significant when measured over months. The distance travelled by light from the planet (or its moon) to Earth is shorter when the Earth is at the point in its orbit that is closest to its planet than when the Earth is at the farthest point in its orbit, the difference in distance being thediameterof the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The observed change in the moon's orbital period is caused by the difference in the time it takes light to traverse the shorter or longer distance. Rømer observed this effect forJupiter's innermost major moon Io and deduced that light takes 22 minutes to cross the diameter of the Earth's orbit.[95]\n\nAnother method is to use theaberration of light, discovered and explained byJames Bradleyin the 18th century.[97]This effect results from thevector additionof the velocity of light arriving from a distant source (such as a star) and the velocity of its observer (see diagram on the right). A moving observer thus sees the light coming from a slightly different direction and consequently sees the source at a position shifted from its original position. Since the direction of the Earth's velocity changes continuously as the Earth orbits the Sun, this effect causes the apparent position of stars to move around. From the angular difference in the position of stars (maximally 20.5arcseconds)[98]it is possible to express the speed of light in terms of the Earth's velocity around the Sun, which with the known length of a year can be converted to the time needed to travel from the Sun to the Earth. In 1729, Bradley used this method to derive that light travelled10210times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is10066times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.[97]\n\nAn astronomical unit (AU) is approximately the average distance between the Earth and Sun. It was redefined in 2012 as exactly149597870700m.[99][100]Previously the AU was not based on theInternational System of Unitsbut in terms of the gravitational force exerted by the Sun in the framework of classical mechanics.[Note 11]The current definition uses the recommended value in metres for the previous definition of the astronomical unit, which was determined by measurement.[99]This redefinition is analogous to that of the metre and likewise has the effect of fixing the speed of light to an exact value in astronomical units per second (via the exact speed of light in metres per second).[102]\n\nPreviously, the inverse ofcexpressed in seconds per astronomical unit was measured by comparing the time for radio signals to reach different spacecraft in the Solar System, with their position calculated from the gravitational effects of the Sun and various planets. By combining many such measurements, abest fitvalue for the light time per unit distance could be obtained. For example, in 2009, the best estimate, as approved by theInternational Astronomical Union(IAU), was:[103][104]\n\nThe relative uncertainty in these measurements is 0.02 parts per billion (2×10−11), equivalent to the uncertainty in Earth-based measurements of length by interferometry.[105]Since the metre is defined to be the length travelled by light in a certain time interval, the measurement of the light time in terms of the previous definition of the astronomical unit can also be interpreted as measuring the length of an AU (old definition) in metres.[Note 12]\n\nA method of measuring the speed of light is to measure the time needed for light to travel to a mirror at a known distance and back. This is the working principle behind experiments byHippolyte FizeauandLéon Foucault.\n\nThesetup as used by Fizeauconsists of a beam of light directed at a mirror 8 kilometres (5 mi) away. On the way from the source to the mirror, the beam passes through a rotating cogwheel. At a certain rate of rotation, the beam passes through one gap on the way out and another on the way back, but at slightly higher or lower rates, the beam strikes a tooth and does not pass through the wheel. Knowing the distance between the wheel and the mirror, the number of teeth on the wheel, and the rate of rotation, the speed of light can be calculated.[106]\n\nThemethod of Foucaultreplaces the cogwheel with a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light travels to the distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it is on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.[107]Foucault used this apparatus to measure the speed of light in air versus water, based on a suggestion byFrançois Arago.[108]\n\nToday, usingoscilloscopeswith time resolutions of less than one nanosecond, the speed of light can be directly measured by timing the delay of a light pulse from a laser or an LED reflected from a mirror. This method is less precise (with errors of the order of 1%) than other modern techniques, but it is sometimes used as a laboratory experiment in college physics classes.[109]\n\nAn option for derivingcthat does not directly depend on a measurement of the propagation of electromagnetic waves is to use the relation betweencand thevacuum permittivityε0andvacuum permeabilityμ0established by Maxwell's theory:c2= 1/(ε0μ0). The vacuum permittivity may be determined by measuring thecapacitanceand dimensions of acapacitor, whereas the value of the vacuum permeability was historically fixed at exactly4π×10−7H⋅m−1through the definition of theampere.RosaandDorseyused this method in 1907 to find a value of299710±22 km/s. Their method depended upon having a standard unit of electrical resistance, the \"internationalohm\", and so its accuracy was limited by how this standard was defined.[110][111]\n\nAnother way to measure the speed of light is to independently measure the frequencyfand wavelengthλof an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value ofccan then be found by using the relationc=fλ. One option is to measure the resonance frequency of acavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946,Louis Essenand A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety ofnormal modesof microwaves of amicrowave cavityof precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8 μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry.[110]As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and fromelectromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.[110][112]\n\nThe Essen–Gordon-Smith result,299792±9 km/s, was substantially more precise than those found by optical techniques.[110]By 1950, repeated measurements by Essen established a result of299792.5±3.0 km/s.[113]\n\nA household demonstration of this technique is possible, using amicrowave ovenand food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at theantinodes(the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back of the oven, typically 2450 MHz), the value ofccan be calculated, \"often with less than 5% error\".[114][115]\n\nInterferometryis another method to find the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation for determining the speed of light.[Note 13]Acoherentbeam of light (e.g. from alaser), with a known frequency (f), is split to follow two paths and then recombined. By adjusting the path length while observing theinterference patternand carefully measuring the change in path length, the wavelength of the light (λ) can be determined. The speed of light is then calculated using the equationc=λf.\n\nBefore the advent of laser technology, coherentradiosources were used for interferometry measurements of the speed of light.[117]Interferometric determination of wavelength becomes less precise with wavelength and the experiments were thus limited in precision by the long wavelength (~4 mm (0.16 in)) of the radiowaves. The precision can be improved by using light with a shorter wavelength, but then it becomes difficult to directly measure the frequency of the light.[118]\n\nOne way around this problem is to start with a low frequency signal of which the frequency can be precisely measured, and from this signal progressively synthesize higher frequency signals whose frequency can then be linked to the original signal. A laser can then be locked to the frequency, and its wavelength can be determined using interferometry.[118]This technique was due to a group at the National Bureau of Standards (which later became theNational Institute of Standards and Technology). They used it in 1972 to measure the speed of light in vacuum with afractional uncertaintyof3.5×10−9.[118][119]\n\nUntil theearly modern period, it was not known whether light travelled instantaneously or at a very fast finite speed. The first extant recorded examination of this subject was inancient Greece. The ancient Greeks, Arabic scholars, and classical European scientists long debated this until Rømer provided the first calculation of the speed of light. Einstein's theory of special relativity postulates that the speed of light is constant regardless of one's frame of reference. Since then, scientists have provided increasingly accurate measurements.\n\nEmpedocles(c. 490–430 BCE) was the first to propose a theory of light[128]and claimed that light has a finite speed.[129]He maintained that light was something in motion, and therefore must take some time to travel.Aristotleargued, to the contrary, that \"light is due to the presence of something, but it is not a movement\".[130]EuclidandPtolemyadvanced Empedocles'emission theoryof vision, where light is emitted from the eye, thus enabling sight. Based on that theory,Heron of Alexandriaargued that the speed of light must beinfinitebecause distant objects such as stars appear immediately upon opening the eyes.[131]\n\nEarly Islamic philosophersinitially agreed with theAristotelian viewthat light had no speed of travel. In 1021,Alhazen(Ibn al-Haytham) published theBook of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory ofvisionin favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye.[132]This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed,[130][133][134]and that the speed of light is variable, decreasing in denser bodies.[134][135]He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from the senses.[136]Also in the 11th century,Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnīagreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than the speed of sound.[137]\n\nIn the 13th century,Roger Baconargued that the speed of light in air was not infinite, using philosophical arguments backed by the writing of Alhazen and Aristotle.[138][139]In the 1270s,Witeloconsidered the possibility of light travelling at infinite speed in vacuum, but slowing down in denser bodies.[140]\n\nIn the early 17th century,Johannes Keplerbelieved that the speed of light was infinite since empty space presents no obstacle to it.René Descartesargued that if the speed of light were to be finite, the Sun, Earth, and Moon would be noticeably out of alignment during alunar eclipse. Although this argument fails when aberration of light is taken into account, the latter was not recognized until the following century.[141]Since such misalignment had not been observed, Descartes concluded the speed of light was infinite. Descartes speculated that if the speed of light were found to be finite, his whole system of philosophy might be demolished.[130]Despite this, in his derivation ofSnell's law, Descartes assumed that some kind of motion associated with light was faster in denser media.[142][143]Pierre de Fermatderived Snell's law using the opposing assumption, the denser the medium the slower light travelled. Fermat also argued in support of a finite speed of light.[144]\n\nIn 1629,Isaac Beeckmanproposed an experiment in which a person observes the flash of a cannon reflecting off a mirror about one mile (1.6 km) away. In 1638,Galileo Galileiproposed an experiment, with an apparent claim to having performed it some years earlier, to measure the speed of light by observing the delay between uncovering a lantern and its perception some distance away. He was unable to distinguish whether light travel was instantaneous or not, but concluded that if it were not, it must nevertheless be extraordinarily rapid.[120][121]In 1667, theAccademia del Cimentoof Florence reported that it had performed Galileo's experiment, with the lanterns separated by about one mile, but no delay was observed.[145]The actual delay in this experiment would have been about 11microseconds.\n\nThe first quantitative estimate of the speed of lightwas made in 1676 by Ole Rømer.[95][96]From the observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moonIoappeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit.Christiaan Huygenscombined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of220000km/s, which is 27% lower than the actual value.[124]\n\nIn his 1704 bookOpticks,Isaac Newtonreported Rømer's calculations of the finite speed of light and gave a value of \"seven or eight minutes\" for the time taken for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth (the modern value is 8 minutes 19 seconds).[146]Newton queried whether Rømer's eclipse shadows were coloured. Hearing that they were not, he concluded the different colours travelled at the same speed. In 1729,James Bradleydiscoveredstellar aberration.[97]From this effect he determined that light must travel 10,210 times faster than the Earth in its orbit (the modern figure is 10,066 times faster) or, equivalently, that it would take light 8 minutes 12 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth.[97]\n\nIn the 19th centuryHippolyte Fizeaudeveloped a method to determine the speed of light based on time-of-flight measurements on Earth and reported a value of315000km/s.[147]His method was improved upon byLéon Foucaultwho obtained a value of298000km/sin 1862.[106]In the year 1856,Wilhelm Eduard WeberandRudolf Kohlrauschmeasured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/√ε0μ0, by discharging aLeyden jar, and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following yearGustav Kirchhoffcalculated that an electric signal in aresistancelesswire travels along the wire at this speed.[148]\n\nIn the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that, according to the theory of electromagnetism he was working on, electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space[149]at a speed equal to the above Weber/Kohlrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave.[150]Maxwell backed up his claim with his own experiment published in the 1868 Philosophical Transactions which determined the ratio of the electrostatic and electromagnetic units of electricity.[151]\n\nThe wave properties of light were well known sinceThomas Young. In the 19th century, physicists believed light was propagating in a medium called aether (or ether). But for electric force, it looks more like the gravitational force in Newton's law. A transmitting medium was not required. After Maxwell theory unified light and electric and magnetic waves, it was favored that both light and electric magnetic waves propagate in the same aether medium (or called theluminiferous aether).[152]\n\nIt was thought at the time that empty space was filled with a background medium called the luminiferous aether in which the electromagnetic field existed. Some physicists thought that this aether acted as apreferred frameof reference for the propagation of light and therefore it should be possible to measure the motion of the Earth with respect to this medium, by measuring theisotropyof the speed of light. Beginning in the 1880s several experiments were performed to try to detect this motion, the most famous of which isthe experimentperformed byAlbert A. MichelsonandEdward W. Morleyin 1887.[153][154]The detected motion was found to always be nil (within observational error). Modern experiments indicate that the two-way speed of light isisotropic(the same in every direction) to within 6 nanometres per second.[155]\n\nBecause of this experimentHendrik Lorentzproposed that the motion of the apparatus through the aether may cause the apparatus tocontractalong its length in the direction of motion, and he further assumed that the time variable for moving systems must also be changed accordingly (\"local time\"), which led to the formulation of theLorentz transformation. Based onLorentz's aether theory,Henri Poincaré(1900) showed that this local time (to first order inv/c) is indicated by clocks moving in the aether, which are synchronized under the assumption of constant light speed. In 1904, he speculated that the speed of light could be a limiting velocity in dynamics, provided that the assumptions of Lorentz's theory are all confirmed. In 1905, Poincaré brought Lorentz's aether theory into full observational agreement with theprinciple of relativity.[156][157]\n\nIn 1905 Einstein postulated from the outset that the speed of light in vacuum, measured by a non-accelerating observer, is independent of the motion of the source or observer. Using this and the principle of relativity as a basis he derived thespecial theory of relativity, in which the speed of light in vacuumcfeatured as a fundamental constant, also appearing in contexts unrelated to light. This made the concept of the stationary aether (to which Lorentz and Poincaré still adhered) useless and revolutionized the concepts of space and time.[158][159]\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, much progress was made in increasing the accuracy of measurements of the speed of light, first by cavity resonance techniques and later by laser interferometer techniques. These were aided by new, more precise, definitions of the metre and second. In 1950,Louis Essendetermined the speed as299792.5±3.0 km/s, using cavity resonance.[113]This value was adopted by the 12th General Assembly of the Radio-Scientific Union in 1957. In 1960, themetre was redefinedin terms of the wavelength of a particular spectral line ofkrypton-86, and, in 1967, the second was redefined in terms of the hyperfine transition frequency of the ground state ofcaesium-133.[160]\n\nIn 1972, using the laser interferometer method and the new definitions, a group at the USNational Bureau of StandardsinBoulder, Coloradodetermined the speed of light in vacuum to bec=299792456.2±1.1 m/s. This was 100 times less uncertain than the previously accepted value. The remaining uncertainty was mainly related to the definition of the metre.[Note 15][119]As similar experiments found comparable results forc, the 15thGeneral Conference on Weights and Measuresin 1975 recommended using the value299792458m/sfor the speed of light.[163]\n\nIn 1983 the 17th meeting of the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) found that wavelengths from frequency measurements and a given value for the speed of light are morereproduciblethan the previous standard. They kept the 1967 definition of second, so thecaesiumhyperfine frequencywould now determine both the second and the metre. To do this, they redefined the metre as \"the length of the path traveled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458of a second\".[94]\n\nAs a result of this definition, the value of the speed of light in vacuum is exactly299792458m/s[164][165]and has become a defined constant in the SI system of units.[14]Improved experimental techniques that, prior to 1983, would have measured the speed of light no longer affect the known value of the speed of light in SI units, but instead allow a more precise realization of the metre by more accurately measuring the wavelength of krypton-86 and other light sources.[166][167]\n\nIn 2011, the CGPM stated its intention to redefine all seven SI base units using what it calls \"the explicit-constant formulation\", where each \"unit is defined indirectly by specifying explicitly an exact value for a well-recognized fundamental constant\", as was done for the speed of light. It proposed a new, but completely equivalent, wording of the metre's definition: \"The metre, symbol m, is the unit of length; its magnitude is set by fixing the numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum to be equal to exactly299792458when it is expressed in the SI unitm s−1.\"[168]This was one of the changes that was incorporated in the2019 revision of the SI, also termed theNew SI.[169]",

    "content": "Beyond the limits of light: exploring the speed of light and the boundaries of faster-than-light travel\n\nWhen you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.Here’s how it works.\n\nThe speed of light traveling through a vacuum is exactly 299,792,458 meters (983,571,056 feet) per second. That's about 186,282 miles per second — a universal constant known in equations as \"c,\" or light speed.\n\nAccording to physicistAlbert Einstein'stheory of special relativity, on which much of modern physics is based, nothing in the universe can travel faster than light. The theory states that as matter approaches the speed of light, the matter's mass becomes infinite. That means the speed of light functions as a speed limit for the wholeuniverse.\n\nThe speed of light is so immutable that, according to the U.S.National Institute of Standards and Technology, it is used to define international standard measurements like the meter (and by extension, the mile, the foot and the inch). Through some crafty equations, it also helps define the kilogram and the temperature unitKelvin.\n\nBut despite the speed of light's reputation as a universal constant, scientists and science fiction writers alike spend time contemplating faster-than-light travel. So far no one's been able to demonstrate a real warp drive, but that hasn't slowed our collective hurtle toward new stories, new inventions and new realms of physics.\n\nAlight-yearis the distance that light can travel in one year — about 6 trillion miles (10 trillion kilometers). It's one way that astronomers and physicists measure immense distances across our universe.\n\nLight travels from themoonto our eyes in about 1 second, which means the moon is about 1 light-second away. Sunlight takes about 8 minutes to reach our eyes, so thesunis about 8 light minutes away. Light fromAlpha Centauri, which is the nearest star system to our own, requires roughly 4.3 years to get here, so Alpha Centauri is 4.3 light-years away.\n\n\"To obtain an idea of the size of a light-year, take the circumference of the Earth (24,900 miles), lay it out in a straight line, multiply the length of the line by 7.5 (the corresponding distance is one light-second), then place 31.6 million similar lines end to end,\" NASA's Glenn Research Centersays on its website. \"The resulting distance is almost 6 trillion (6,000,000,000,000) miles!\"\n\nAn airplane traveling 600 mph (965 km/h) would take 1 million years to travel a single light-year! If we could travel one light-year using a crewed spacecraft like the Apollo lunar module, the journey would take approximately 27,000 years, according to theBBC Sky at Night Magazine.\n\nStars and other objects beyond oursolar systemlie anywhere from a few light-years to a few billion light-years away. And everything astronomers \"see\" in the distant universe is literally history. When astronomers study objects that are far away, they are seeing light that shows the objects as they existed at the time that light left them.\n\nThis principle allows astronomers to see the universe as it looked after theBig Bang, which took place about 13.8 billion years ago. Objects that are 10 billion light-years away from us appear to astronomers as they looked 10 billion years ago — relatively soon after the beginning of the universe — rather than how they appear today.\n\nRelated:Why the universe is all history\n\nWe asked Rob Zellem, exoplanet-hunter and staff scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab, a few frequently asked questions about the speed of light.\n\nDr. Rob Zellem is a staff scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a federally funded research and development center operated by the California Institute of Technology. Rob is the project lead for Exoplanet Watch, a citizen science project to observe exoplanets, planets outside of our own solar system, with small telescopes. He is also the Science Calibration lead for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraph Instrument, which will directly image exoplanets.\n\nNothing! Light is a \"universal speed limit\" and, according to Einstein's theory of relativity, is the fastest speed in the universe: 300,000 kilometers per second (186,000 miles per second).\n\nThe speed of light is a universal constant in a vacuum, like the vacuum of space. However, light *can* slow down slightly when it passes through an absorbing medium, like water (225,000 kilometers per second = 140,000 miles per second) or glass (200,000 kilometers per second = 124,000 miles per second).\n\nOne of the first measurements of the speed of light was by Ole Rømer in 1676 by observing themoons of Jupiter. The speed of light was first measured to high precision in 1879 by the Michelson-Morley Experiment.\n\nOle Rømer was able to measure the speed of light by observing eclipses of Jupiter's moon Io. When Jupiter was closer to Earth, Rømer noted that eclipses of Io occurred slightly earlier than when Jupiter was farther away. Rømer attributed this effect to the time it takes for light to travel over the longer distance when Jupiter was farther from the Earth.\n\n\n\nAs early as the 5th century BC, Greek philosophers like Empedocles and Aristotle disagreed on the nature of light speed. Empedocles proposed that light, whatever it was made of, must travel and therefore, must have a rate of travel. Aristotle wrote a rebuttal of Empedocles' view in his own treatise,On Sense and the Sensible, arguing that light, unlike sound and smell, must be instantaneous. Aristotle was wrong, of course, but it would take hundreds of years for anyone to prove it.\n\nIn the mid 1600s, the Italian astronomerGalileo Galileistood two people on hills less than a mile apart. Each person held a shielded lantern. One uncovered his lantern; when the other person saw the flash, he uncovered his too. But Galileo's experimental distance wasn't far enough for his participants to record the speed of light. He could only conclude that light traveled at least 10 times faster than sound.\n\nIn the 1670s, Danish astronomer Ole Rømer tried to create a reliable timetable for sailors at sea, andaccording to NASA, accidentally came up with a new best estimate for the speed of light. To create an astronomical clock, he recorded the precise timing of the eclipses ofJupiter's moon, Io, fromEarth. Over time, Rømer observed that Io's eclipses often differed from his calculations. He noticed that the eclipses appeared to lag the most whenJupiterand Earth were moving away from one another, showed up ahead of time when the planets were approaching and occurred on schedule when the planets were at their closest or farthest points. This observation demonstrated what we today know as the Doppler effect, the change in frequency of light or sound emitted by a moving object that in the astronomical world manifests as the so-calledredshift, the shift towards \"redder\", longer wavelengths in objects speeding away from us. In a leap of intuition, Rømer determined that light was taking measurable time to travel from Io to Earth.\n\nRømer used his observations to estimate the speed of light. Since the size of the solar system and Earth's orbit wasn't yet accurately known, argued a 1998 paper in theAmerican Journal of Physics, he was a bit off. But at last, scientists had a number to work with. Rømer's calculation put the speed of light at about 124,000 miles per second (200,000 km/s).\n\nIn 1728, English physicist James Bradley based a new set of calculations on the change in the apparent position of stars caused by Earth's travels around the sun. He estimated the speed of light at 185,000 miles per second (301,000 km/s) — accurate to within about 1% of the real value, according to theAmerican Physical Society.\n\nTwo new attempts in the mid-1800s brought the problem back to Earth. French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau set a beam of light on a rapidly rotating toothed wheel, with a mirror set up 5 miles (8 km) away to reflect it back to its source. Varying the speed of the wheel allowed Fizeau to calculate how long it took for the light to travel out of the hole, to the adjacent mirror, and back through the gap. Another French physicist, Leon Foucault, used a rotating mirror rather than a wheel to perform essentially the same experiment. The two independent methods each came within about 1,000 miles per second (1,609 km/s) of the speed of light.\n\n\n\nAnother scientist who tackled the speed of light mystery was Poland-born Albert A. Michelson, who grew up in California during the state's gold rush period, and honed his interest in physics while attending the U.S. Naval Academy, according to theUniversity of Virginia. In 1879, he attempted to replicate Foucault's method of determining the speed of light, but Michelson increased the distance between mirrors and used extremely high-quality mirrors and lenses. Michelson's result of 186,355 miles per second (299,910 km/s) was accepted as the most accurate measurement of the speed of light for 40 years, until Michelson re-measured it himself. In his second round of experiments, Michelson flashed lights between two mountain tops with carefully measured distances to get a more precise estimate. And in his third attempt just before his death in 1931, according to the Smithsonian'sAir and Spacemagazine, he built a mile-long depressurized tube of corrugated steel pipe. The pipe simulated a near-vacuum that would remove any effect of air on light speed for an even finer measurement, which in the end was just slightly lower than the accepted value of the speed of light today.\n\nMichelson also studied the nature of light itself, wrote astrophysicist Ethan Siegal in the Forbes science blog,Starts With a Bang. The best minds in physics at the time of Michelson's experiments were divided: Was light a wave or a particle?\n\nMichelson, along with his colleague Edward Morley, worked under the assumption that light moved as a wave, just like sound. And just as sound needs particles to move, Michelson and Morley and other physicists of the time reasoned, light must have some kind of medium to move through. This invisible, undetectable stuff was called the \"luminiferous aether\" (also known as \"ether\").\n\nThough Michelson and Morley built a sophisticated interferometer (a very basic version of the instrument used today inLIGOfacilities), Michelson could not find evidence of any kind of luminiferous aether whatsoever. Light, he determined, can and does travel through a vacuum.\n\n\"The experiment — and Michelson's body of work — was so revolutionary that he became the only person in history to have won a Nobel Prize for a very precise non-discovery of anything,\" Siegal wrote. \"The experiment itself may have been a complete failure, but what we learned from it was a greater boon to humanity and our understanding of the universe than any success would have been!\"\n\n\n\nEinstein's theory ofspecial relativityunified energy, matter and the speed of light in a famous equation: E = mc^2. The equation describes the relationship between mass and energy — small amounts of mass (m) contain, or are made up of, an inherently enormous amount of energy (E). (That's what makes nuclear bombs so powerful: They're converting mass into blasts of energy.) Because energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared, the speed of light serves as a conversion factor, explaining exactly how much energy must be within matter. And because the speed of light is such a huge number, even small amounts of mass must equate to vast quantities of energy.\n\nTo accurately describe the universe, Einstein's elegant equation requires the speed of light to be an immutable constant. Einstein asserted that light moved through a vacuum, not any kind of luminiferous aether, and in such a way that it moved at the same speed no matter the speed of the observer.\n\nThink of it like this: Observers sitting on a train could look at a train moving along a parallel track and think of its relative movement to themselves as zero. But observers moving nearly the speed of light would still perceive light as moving away from them at more than 670 million mph. (That's because moving really, really fast is one of the only confirmed methods oftime travel— time actually slows down for those observers, who will age slower and perceive fewer moments than an observer moving slowly.)\n\nIn other words, Einstein proposed that the speed of light doesn't vary with the time or place that you measure it, or how fast you yourself are moving.\n\nTherefore, objects with mass cannot ever reach the speed of light. If an object ever did reach the speed of light, its mass would become infinite. And as a result, the energy required to move the object would also become infinite: an impossibility.\n\nThat means if we base our understanding of physics on special relativity (which most modern physicists do), the speed of light is the immutable speed limit of our universe — the fastest that anything can travel.\n\nAlthough the speed of light is often referred to as the universe's speed limit, the universe actually expands even faster. The universe expands at a little more than 42 miles (68 kilometers) per second for each megaparsec of distance from the observer, wrote astrophysicist Paul Sutter in a previous article forSpace.com. (A megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years — a really long way.)\n\nIn other words, a galaxy 1 megaparsec away appears to be traveling away from theMilky Wayat a speed of 42 miles per second (68 km/s), while a galaxy two megaparsecs away recedes at nearly 86 miles per second (136 km/s), and so on.\n\n\"At some point, at some obscene distance, the speed tips over the scales and exceeds the speed of light, all from the natural, regular expansion of space,\" Sutter explained. \"It seems like it should be illegal, doesn't it?\"\n\nSpecial relativity provides an absolute speed limit within the universe, according to Sutter, but Einstein's 1915 theory regardinggeneral relativityallows different behavior when the physics you're examining are no longer \"local.\"\n\n\"A galaxy on the far side of the universe? That's the domain of general relativity, and general relativity says: Who cares! That galaxy can have any speed it wants, as long as it stays way far away, and not up next to your face,\" Sutter wrote. \"Special relativity doesn't care about the speed — superluminal or otherwise — of a distant galaxy. And neither should you.\"\n\n\n\nLight in a vacuum is generally held to travel at an absolute speed, but light traveling through any material can be slowed down. The amount that a material slows down light is called its refractive index. Light bends when coming into contact with particles, which results in a decrease in speed.\n\nFor example, light traveling through Earth's atmosphere moves almost as fast as light in a vacuum, slowing down by just three ten-thousandths of the speed of light. But light passing through a diamond slows to less than half its typical speed,PBS NOVAreported. Even so, it travels through the gem at over 277 million mph (almost 124,000 km/s) — enough to make a difference, but still incredibly fast.\n\nLight can be trapped — and even stopped — inside ultra-cold clouds of atoms, according to a 2001 study published in the journalNature. More recently, a 2018 study published in the journalPhysical Review Lettersproposed a new way to stop light in its tracks at \"exceptional points,\" or places where two separate light emissions intersect and merge into one.\n\nResearchers have also tried to slow down light even when it's traveling through a vacuum. A team of Scottish scientists successfully slowed down a single photon, or particle of light, even as it moved through a vacuum, as described in their 2015 study published in thejournal Science. In their measurements, the difference between a slowed photon and a \"regular\" photon was just a few millionths of a meter, but it demonstrated that light in a vacuum can be slower than the official speed of light.\n\n—Spaceship could fly faster than light\n\n—Here's what the speed of light looks like in slow motion\n\n—Why is the speed of light the way it is?\n\nScience fiction loves the idea of \"warp speed.\" Faster-than-light travel makes countless sci-fi franchises possible, condensing the vast expanses of space and letting characters pop back and forth between star systems with ease.\n\nBut while faster-than-light travel isn't guaranteed impossible, we'd need to harness some pretty exotic physics to make it work. Luckily for sci-fi enthusiasts and theoretical physicists alike, there are lots of avenues to explore.\n\nAll we have to do is figure out how to not move ourselves — since special relativity would ensure we'd be long destroyed before we reached high enough speed — but instead, move the space around us. Easy, right?\n\nOne proposed idea involves a spaceship that could fold a space-time bubble around itself. Sounds great, both in theory and in fiction.\n\n\"If Captain Kirk were constrained to move at the speed of our fastest rockets, it would take him a hundred thousand years just to get to the next star system,\" said Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) Institute in Mountain View, California, in a 2010 interview withSpace.com's sister site LiveScience. \"So science fiction has long postulated a way to beat the speed of light barrier so the story can move a little more quickly.\"\n\nWithout faster-than-light travel, any \"Star Trek\" (or \"Star War,\" for that matter) would be impossible. If humanity is ever to reach the farthest — and constantly expanding — corners of our universe, it will be up to future physicists to boldly go where no one has gone before.\n\nFor more on the speed of light, check out this fun tool fromAcademothat lets you visualize how fast light can travel from any place on Earth to any other.

    "content": "Thespeed of lightis the rate at which light travels. The speed of light in avacuumis aconstant valuethat is denoted by the lettercand is defined as exactly 299,792,458 meters per second.Visible light, other electromagnetic radiation, gravity waves, and other massless particles travel at c.Matter, which has mass, can approach the speed of light, but never reach it.\n\nHere are values for the speed of light in various units:\n\nThe speed of light in a vacuum is a constant. However, scientists are exploring whether the speed of light has changed over time.\n\nAlso, the rate at which light travels changes as it passes through a medium. Theindex of refractiondescribes this change. For example, theindex of refractionof water is 1.333, which means light travels 1.333 times slower in water than in a vacuum. The index of refraction of a diamond is 2.417. A diamond slows the speed of light by more than half its speed in a vacuum.\n\nOne way of measuring the speed of light uses great distances, such as distant points on the Earth or known distances between the Earth and astronomical objects. For example, you can measure the speed of light by measuring the time it takes for light to travel from a light source to a distant mirror and back again. The other way of measuring the speed of light is solving forcin equations. Now that the speed of light is defined, it is fixed rather than measured. Measuring the speed of light today indirectly measures the length of the meter, rather thanc.\n\nIn 1676, Danish astronomer Ole Rømer discovered light travels at a speed by studying the movement of Jupiter’s moon Io. Prior to this, it seemed light propagated instantaneously. For example, you see a lightning strike immediately, butdon’t hear thunder until after the event. So, Rømer’s finding showed light takes time to travel, but scientists did not know the speed of light or whether it was constant. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell proposed that light was an electromagnetic wave that travelled at a speedc. Albert Einstein suggestedcwas a constant and that it did not change according to the frame of reference of the observer or any motion of a light source. In other words, Einstein suggested the speed of light isinvariant. Since then, numerous experiments have verified the invariance ofc.\n\nThe upper speed limit for massless particles isc. Objects that have mass cannot travel at the speed of light or exceed it. Among other reasons, traveling at c gives an object a length of zero andinfinitemass. Accelerating a mass to the speed of light requires infinite energy. Furthermore, energy, signals, and individual photos cannot travel faster thanc. At first glance, quantum entanglement appears to transmit information faster thanc. When two particles are entangled, changing the state of one particle instantaneously determines the state of the other particle, regardless of the distance between them. But, information cannot be transmitted instantaneously (faster thanc) because it isn’t possible to control the initial quantum state of the particle when it is observed.\n\nHowever, faster-than-light speeds appear in physics. For example, the phase velocity of x-rays through glass often exceeds c. However, the information isn’t conveyed by the waves faster than the speed of light. Distant galaxies appear to move away from Earth faster than the speed of light (outside a distance called the Hubble sphere), but the motion isn’t due to the galaxies traveling through space. Instead, space itself it expanding. So again, no actual movement faster thancoccurs.\n\nWhile it isn’t possible to go faster than the speed of light, it doesn’t necessarily mean warp drive or other faster-than-light travel is impossible. The key to going faster than the speed of light is to change space-time. Ways this might happen include tunneling using wormholes or stretching space-time into a “warp bubble” around a spacecraft. But, so far these theories don’t have practical applications.\n\n\n\n· © 2025Science Notes and Projects· Designed byPress Customizr··Cookies Policy·Terms of Service·",

    "title": "Speed of light: How fast light travels, explained simply and clearly",
    "content": "Introducing the all-new Astronomy.com Forum! Become a part of our Community!>> Visit Now\n\nOn one hand, the speed of light is just a number: 299,792,458 meters per second. And on the other, it’s one of the most important constants that appears in nature and defines the relationship of causality itself.\n\nAs far as we can measure, it is a constant. It is the same speed for every observer in the entire universe. This constancy was first established in the late 1800’s with the experiments ofAlbert Michelson and Edward Morley at Case Western Reserve University. They attempted to measure changes in the speed of light as the Earth orbited around the Sun. They found no such variation, and no experiment ever since then has either.\n\nObservations of the cosmic microwave background, the light released when the universe was 380,000 years old, show that the speed of light hasn’t measurably changed in over 13.8 billion years.\n\nIn fact, we nowdefinethe speed of light to be a constant, with a precise speed of 299,792,458 meters per second. While it remains a remote possibility in deeply theoretical physics that light may not be a constant, for all known purposes it is a constant, so it’s better to just define it and move on with life.\n\nIn 1676 the Danish astronomer Ole Christensen Romer made the first quantitative measurement of how fast light travels. He carefully observed the orbit of Io, the innermost moon of Jupiter. As the Earth circles the Sun in its own orbit, sometimes it approaches Jupiter and sometimes it recedes away from it. When the Earth is approaching Jupiter, the path that light has to travel from Io is shorter than when the Earth is receding away from Jupiter. By carefully measuring the changes to Io’s orbital period, Romer calculated a speed of light of around 220,000 kilometers per second.\n\nObservations continued to improve until by the 19thcentury astronomers and physicists had developed the sophistication to get very close to the modern value. In 1865, James Clerk Maxwell made a remarkable discovery. He was investigating the properties of electricity and magnetism, which for decades had remained mysterious in unconnected laboratory experiments around the world. Maxwell found that electricity and magnetism were really two sides of the same coin, both manifestations of a single electromagnetic force.\n\nAs Maxwell explored the consequences of his new theory, he found that changing magnetic fields can lead to changing electric fields, which then lead to a new round of changing magnetic fields. The fields leapfrog over each other and can even travel through empty space. When Maxwell went to calculate the speed of these electromagnetic waves, he was surprised to see the speed of light pop out – the first theoretical calculation of this important number.\n\nBecause it is defined to be a constant, there’s no need to measure it further. The number we’ve defined is it, with no uncertainty, no error bars. It’s done. But the speed of light is just that – a speed. The number we choose to represent it depends on the units we use: kilometers versus miles, seconds versus hours, and so on. In fact, physicists commonly just set the speed of light to be 1 to make their calculations easier. So instead of trying to measure the speed light travels, physicists turn to more precisely measuring other units, like the length of the meter or the duration of the second. In other words, the defined value of the speed of light is used to establish the length of other units like the meter.\n\nYes, the speed of light is always a constant. But it slows down whenever it travels through a medium like air or water. How does this work? There are a few different ways to present an answer to this question, depending on whether you prefer a particle-like picture or a wave-like picture.\n\nIn a particle-like picture, light is made of tiny little bullets called photons. All those photons always travel at the speed of light, but as light passes through a medium those photons get all tangled up, bouncing around among all the molecules of the medium. This slows down the overall propagation of light, because it takes more time for the group of photons to make it through.\n\nIn a wave-like picture, light is made of electromagnetic waves. When these waves pass through a medium, they get all the charged particles in motion, which in turn generate new electromagnetic waves of their own. These interfere with the original light, forcing it to slow down as it passes through.\n\nEither way, light always travels at the same speed, but matter can interfere with its travel, making it slow down.\n\nThe speed of light is important because it’s about way more than, well, the speed of light. In the early 1900’s Einstein realized just how special this speed is. The old physics, dominated by the work of Isaac Newton, said that the universe had a fixed reference frame from which we could measure all motion. This is why Michelson and Morley went looking for changes in the speed, because it should change depending on our point of view. But their experiments showed that the speed was always constant, so what gives?\n\nEinstein decided to take this experiment at face value. He assumed that the speed of light is a true, fundamental constant. No matter where you are, no matter how fast you’re moving, you’ll always see the same speed.\n\nThis is wild to think about. If you’re traveling at 99% the speed of light and turn on a flashlight, the beam will race ahead of you at…exactly the speed of light, no more, no less. If you’re coming from the opposite direction, you’ll still also measure the exact same speed.\n\nThis constancy forms the basis of Einstein’s special theory of relativity, which tells us that while all motion is relative – different observers won’t always agree on the length of measurements or the duration of events – some things are truly universal, like the speed of light.\n\nNope. Nothing can. Any particle with zero mass must travel at light speed. But anything with mass (which is most of the universe) cannot. The problem is relativity. The faster you go, the more energy you have. But we know from Einstein’s relativity that energy and mass are the same thing. So the more energy you have, the more mass you have, which makes it harder for you to go even faster. You can get as close as you want to the speed of light, but to actually crack that barrier takes an infinite amount of energy. So don’t even try.\n\nIf you think you can find a cheat to get around the limitations of light speed, then I need to tell you about its role in special relativity. You see, it’s not just about light. It just so happens that light travels at this special speed, and it was the first thing we discovered to travel at this speed. So it could have had another name. Indeed, a better name for this speed might be “the speed of time.”\n\nRelated:Is time travel possible? An astrophysicist explains\n\nWe live in a universe of causes and effects. All effects are preceded by a cause, and all causes lead to effects. The speed of light limits how quickly causes can lead to effects. Because it’s a maximum speed limit for any motion or interaction, in a given amount of time there’s a limit to what I can influence. If I want to tap you on the shoulder and you’re right next to me, I can do it right away. But if you’re on the other side of the planet, I have to travel there first. The motion of me traveling to you is limited by the speed of light, so that sets how quickly I can tap you on the shoulder – the speed light travels dictates how quickly a single cause can create an effect.\n\nThe ability to go faster than light would allow effects to happen before their causes. In essence, time travel into the past would be possible with faster-than-light travel. Since we view time as the unbroken chain of causes and effects going from the past to the future, breaking the speed of light would break causality, which would seriously undermine our sense of the forward motion of time.\n\nNo clue. It appears to us as a fundamental constant of nature. We have no theory of physics that explains its existence or why it has the value that it does. We hope that a future understanding of nature will provide this explanation, but right now all investigations are purely theoretical. For now, we just have to take it as a given.\n\nGet newsletters, updates and special offers via email from Astronomy.com!\n\n\"*\" indicates required fields\n\nAstronomy leads the astronomy hobby as the most popular magazine of its kind in the world.

    "content": "\n\nName\n\nEmail\n\n\n\n1. Hi (interjection): A casual and friendly greeting, commonly used in English to say hello or express recognition.2. Hi (interjection): Used to express surprise or joy or to attract attention.3. Hi (adjective): An informal, simplified spelling of high.4. HI (abbreviation): Hawaii, heat index, or high intensity.\n\n\"Hi\" is a versatile word, mainly used as a friendly greeting. However, it can also be used to express surprise or joy. Let's explore more about this simple yet impactful word.\n\n“Hi” is a common and informal way to say hello in English. It can be used in almost any situation where you want to greet someone or show friendliness.Forexample, you can say “hi” to your friends, family, classmates, coworkers, or strangers. “Hi” can also be spelled as “hi” and used as an adjective to describe something that has a high quality or degree. For example, you can say “hi fidelity” to mean a sound system that reproduces sound accurately and clearly.\n\nUsage breakdown:\n\nThe word “hi” can function as different parts of speech depending on its meaning and usage. When used as an interjection, \"hi\" serves as a greeting or an exclamation. In its adjective form, \"hi\" modifies nouns or noun phrases. Furthermore, when “hi” is used as a noun, it refers to either a greeting or a high state or condition. As an interjection, “hi” does not have any grammatical function in a sentence. It is usuallyfollowedby a comma or an exclamation mark.\n\nFor example:\n\nThe pronunciation of \"hi\" is straightforward and resembles its spelling.\n\nPhonetic Pronunciation:haɪ (rhymes with \"sky\")\n\n\"Hi\" has a number of synonyms, primarily revolving around greetings.\n\nAs \"hi\" is a greeting, its antonyms would relate to farewells.\n\nHere are ten sentences that demonstrate the varied contexts in which \"hi\" can be used:\n\n1.Hi, how have you been?2. I just dropped by to sayhiand see how you're doing.3. When you see Jennifer, give her a bighifor me.4. Alwaysstay tuned, as the DJ often plays tracks that havehi-energy afterward.5. When you enter the room and see Sarah trying tolie low, just say \"hi\" and leave her alone.6. A simplehican make someone's day brighter.7.Hi!I'm Peter; I'llkeep you postedabout our tasks for the day.8. I missed the chance to sayhiwhen she passed by.9. Before Itake leave, I'll greet Mark with a quick \"hi\" and inform him about the points of our meeting.10. I received a card with just a \"bighifrom Paris\" written on it.\n\nThe word \"hi\" is frequently usedinspoken English due to its role as a common greeting. It's especially prevalent in informal settings and personal communications. In many interactions, particularly among the younger generation, \"hi\" is a favored way to start a conversation or acknowledge someone.\n\n\"Hi\" doesn't have many variants in the context of a greeting. However, some colloquial or playful forms of it are used in casual conversations.\n\n1.Hiya:A cheerful and informal variant of \"hi.\"2.Hey:Another informal greeting similar to \"hi.\"\n\nThe term \"hi\" is primarily used as a greeting. However, several related terms and phrases convey similar sentiments or are used in similar contexts.\n\n1. Hello2. Hey3. Hiya4. Howdy5. Greetings6. Salutations7. Aloha8. Hola\n\nThe word \"hi\" can be traced back to the late Middle English period, and it has been used as an informal greeting for centuries. It is derived from the word \"hey,\"whichhas similar origins to the Old High German word \"hē, hēr\" and the Middle Dutch word \"hei.\" Over time, \"hi\" has become one of the most commonly used greetings in the English language.\n\nWhile \"hi\" is straightforward, few derivatives or compound words are associated with it.\n\n1.Hiya:An informal and friendly way to say \"hi.\"2.Hi-Fi:A term used to describe sound reproduction to a high accuracy standard.3.High-five:A gesture of celebration or agreement where two people slap their open hand (usually the palm) against each other's.\n\nMisspellings are rare because \"hi\" is a short, two-letter word. However, variations can be seen in informal digital communications, although they aren't technically \"misspellings.\"\n\n1. Hii2. Hai\n\nWhile there aren't many idioms directly related to \"hi,\" there are idioms and phrases related to greetings or making one's presence known.\n\n1.Break the ice2. Roll out the red carpet3. Put out the welcome mat4. Shoot the breeze5. Chew the fat6. Make oneself at home7. Long time no see8. Drop a line9. Give a shout out10.

    "content": "This is an accepted version of this page\n\n\n\nJakarta[b](/dʒəˈkɑːrtə/;Indonesian pronunciation:[dʒaˈkarta]ⓘ,Betawi:Jakartè), officially theSpecial Capital Region of Jakarta(Indonesian:Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta;DKI Jakarta)  and formerly known asBataviauntil 1949, is thecapital cityofIndonesiaand an autonomous region at the provincial level. Lying on the northwest coast ofJava, the world'smost populous island, Jakarta is thelargest metropoleinSoutheast Asiaand serves as the diplomatic capital ofASEAN. The Special Region has a status equivalent to that of aprovinceand is bordered by two other provinces:West Javato the south and east; and (since 2000, when it was separated from West Java)Bantento the west. Its coastline faces theJava Seato the north, and it shares a maritime border withLampungto the west.Jakarta's metropolitan areaisASEAN's second largest economyafterSingapore. In 2023, the city'sGDPPPP was estimated at US$724.010 billion.\n\nJakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia. Although Jakarta extends over only 661.23 km2(255.30 sq mi) and thus has the smallest area of anyIndonesian province, itsmetropolitan areacovers 7,076.31 km2(2,732.18 sq mi), which includes the satellite cities ofBogor,Depok,Tangerang,South Tangerang, andBekasi, and has an estimated population of 32.6 million as of 2022[update], making it thelargest urban area in Indonesiaand thesecond-largest in the world(afterTokyo). Jakarta ranksfirst among the Indonesian provincesin thehuman development index. Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer a potentially higherstandard of livingcompared to other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesianarchipelago, making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.\n\nJakarta is one of theoldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia. Established in the fourth century asSunda Kelapa, the city became an important trading port for theSunda Kingdom. At one time, it was thede factocapital of theDutch East Indies, when it was known asBatavia. Jakarta was officially a city withinWest Javauntil 1960 when its official status was changed to aprovincewithspecial capital regiondistinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and oneadministrative regency. Jakarta is analpha world cityand the ASEAN secretariat's seat. Financial institutions such as theBank of Indonesia,Indonesia Stock Exchange, and corporate headquarters of numerousIndonesian companiesandmultinational corporationsare located in the city.\n\nJakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, air pollution, gridlocked traffic, congestion, andfloodingdue to subsidence and water extraction (sea level rise is relative, not absolute). Part of North Jakarta is sinking up to 17 cm (6.7 inches) annually, meanwhile the southern part is relatively safe. This has made the northern part of the city more prone to flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In response to these challenges, in August 2019, PresidentJoko Widodoannounced plans tomove the capitalfrom Jakarta to the planned city ofNusantara, in the province ofEast Kalimantanon the island ofBorneo. TheMPRapproved the move on 18 January 2022. The Indonesian government is not abandoning Jakarta after announcing plans to move the country's capital, its planning minister said, pledging to spend US$40 billion, which is more than the cost to buildNusantara, to save the city in the next decade.[12]\n\nJakarta has been home to multiplesettlements. Below is the list of names used during its existence:\n\nTheBuni peopleis a prehistoricclay potteryculture that flourished in coastal northernWest Java, Jakarta, andBantenaround 400 BC to 100 AD[13][page needed]and survived until 500 AD.\n\nSundapurais the name mentioned in theTugu inscriptionfromTarumanagara, a kingdom in coastal West Java. The strategic geographical position of coastal West Java, which corresponds to today modern Jakarta, is a commanding region that controls the Sunda Strait. This location is strategic in regard toSumatraand also its connection to Asian continent ofIndiaandChina.\n\nAfter fall of the Tarumanagara, the name of city was changed to 'Sunda Kelapa' or 'Coconut of Sunda,' growing to be the main harbour for theSunda Kingdomdue to its desirable location.[14][15]\n\nThe name 'Jakarta' is derived from the wordJayakarta(Devanagari: जयकर्त), which is ultimately derived from theSanskritजयjaya(victorious),[16]and कृतkrta(accomplished, acquired),[17]thusJayakartatranslates as 'victorious deed', 'complete act', or 'complete victory'. It was named for the Muslim troops ofFatahillahwhich successfully defeated and drove the Portuguese away from the city in 1527, eventually renaming it 'Jayakarta.'[18]Tomé Pires, a Portuguese apothecary, wrote the name of the city in hismagnum opusasJacatraorJacartaduring his journey to theEast Indies.[19]\n\nAfter the Dutch East India Company took over the area in 1619, they renamed it to 'Batavia,' after theBatavi, a Germanic tribe who were seen as the ancestors of the Dutch. The city was then also known asKoningin van het Oosten(Queen of the Orient), a name that was given for the urban beauty ofdowntown Batavia'scanals, mansions and ordered city layout.[20]After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to be more associated with the suburbs (e.g.Mentengand the area aroundMerdeka Square), with their wide lanes, green spaces and villas.[21]\n\nDuring theJapanese occupation, the city was renamed asJakaruta Tokubetsu-shi(ジャカルタ特別市, Jakarta Special City).[14]After the Japanese surrender, the name was changed to 'Jakarta.'[14]\n\nThe north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of prehistoricBuni culturethat flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD.[22]The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-centurySundanesekingdom ofTarumanagara, one of the oldestHindukingdoms in Indonesia.[23]The area ofNorth JakartaaroundTugubecame a populated settlement in the early 5th century. TheTugu inscription(probably written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village,Koja,North Jakarta, mentions that KingPurnawarmanof Tarumanagara undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital.[24]Following the decline ofTarumanagara, its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the HinduKingdom of Sunda. From the 7th to the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under theSrivijayamaritime empire. According to the Chinese source,Chu-fan-chi, written circa 1225,Chou Ju-kuareported in the early 13th century that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java (Sunda).[25]The source says the port of Sunda is strategic and thriving, mentioningpepperfrom Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and their houses were built on wooden piles.[26]The harbour area became known asSunda Kelapa(Sundanese:ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮨᮜᮕ) and by the 14th century, it was an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.\n\nThe first European fleet, four Portuguese ships fromMalacca, arrived in 1513 while looking for a route to obtain spices.[27]The Sunda Kingdommade an alliance treatywith the Portuguese by allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power ofDemak Sultanatefrom central Java.[18]In 1527,Fatahillah, a Pasai-born military commander of Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta,[18]and became a fiefdom of theBanten Sultanate, which became a major Southeast Asian trading centre.\n\nThrough the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of the Banten Sultanate, Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, an EnglishEast India Company(EIC) voyage led by SirJames Lancasterarrived inAcehand sailed on toBanten, where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of English trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682.[28]Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English merchants, who were rivals with the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.[27]\n\nWhen relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. His army and their EIC allies, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival ofJan Pieterszoon Coen. The Dutch burned the EIC trading post and forced them to retreat to their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power, and they renamed the cityBataviain 1619.\n\nCommercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese weremassacredby the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740, and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved toGlodokoutside the city walls.[29]At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number that changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded were fabrics, mainly imported cotton,batikand clothing worn by Arab communities.[30]\n\nThe city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to move away from the port. TheKoningsplein, nowMerdeka Squarewas completed in 1818, the housing park ofMentengwas started in 1913,[31]andKebayoran Baruwas the last Dutch-built residential area.[29]By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,[32]including 37,067 Europeans.[33]The city was expanded in 1935 through the annexation of the town of Meester Cornelis, modernJatinegara.[34]\n\nOn 5 March 1942, the Japanese capturedBataviafrom Dutch control, and the city was named Jakarta (Jakarta Special City(ジャカルタ特別市,Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi), under the special status that was assigned to the city). After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognised until full Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The city, now renamed Jakarta, was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.\n\nAfterWorld War IIended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945,[35]and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in the following month. During theIndonesian National Revolution, Indonesian republicans withdrew fromAllied-occupied Jakarta and established their capital inYogyakarta.\n\nAfter securing full independence, Jakarta again became the national capital in 1950.[29]With Jakarta selected to host the1962 Asian Games,Sukarno, envisaging Jakarta as a great international city, instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic andmodernist architecture.[36]Projects includeda cloverleaf interchange, a major boulevard (Jalan MH Thamrin-Sudirman), monuments such asThe National Monument,Hotel Indonesia, a shopping centre, and a new building intended to be the headquarters ofCONEFO. In October 1965, Jakarta was the site ofan abortive coupattempt in which six top generals were killed, precipitatinga violent anti-communist purgewhich killed at least 500,000 people, including some ethnic Chinese.[37]The event markedthe beginning of Suharto's New Order. The first government was led by a mayor until the end of 1960 when the office was changed to that of a governor. The last mayor of Jakarta wasSoedirountil he was replaced bySoemarno Sosroatmodjoas governor.\n\nIn 1966, Jakarta was declared a 'special capital region' (Daerah Khusus Ibukota), with a status equivalent to that of a province.[38]Based on law No. 5 of 1974 relating to regional governments, the Jakarta Special Capital Region was confirmed as the capital of Indonesia and one of the country's then 26 provinces.[39]Lieutenant GeneralAli Sadikinserved as governor from 1966 to 1977; he rehabilitated roads and bridges, encouraged the arts, and built hospitals and a large number of schools. He cleared out slum dwellers for new development projects — some for the benefit of the Suharto family,[40]— and attempted to eliminate rickshaws and ban street vendors. He began control of migration to the city to stem overcrowding and poverty.[41]Foreign investment contributed to a real estate boom that transformed the face of Jakarta.[42]The boom ended with the1997 Asian financial crisis, putting Jakarta at the centre of violence, protest, and political manoeuvring.\n\nAfter three decades in power, support for PresidentSuhartobegan to wane. Tensions peaked when four students wereshot deadatTrisakti Universityby security forces.Four days of riots and violencein 1998 ensued that killed an estimated 1,200, and destroyed or damaged 6,000 buildings, forcing Suharto to resign.[43]Much of the rioting targetedChinese Indonesians.[44]In the post-Suharto era, Jakarta has remained the focal point of democratic change in Indonesia.[45]Jemaah Islamiyah-connected bombings occurred almost annually in the city between 2000 and 2005,[29]withanother in 2009.[46]In August 2007, Jakarta heldits first-ever election to choose a governoras part of a nationwide decentralisation program that allows direct local elections in several areas. Previously, governors were elected by the city's legislative body.[47]\n\nDuring theJokowipresidency, the Government adopted a plan to move Indonesia's capital toNusantaraafter 17 August 2024,[48]but this has not occurred due to delays.[49]\n\nBetween2016and2017, a series of terrorist attacks rocked Jakarta with scenes of multiple suicide bombings and gunfire.Abu Bakr al-Baghdadiclaimed responsibility for the attacks on behalf ofIslamic State.\n\nJakarta covers 661.23 km2(255.30 sq mi), the smallest among anyIndonesian provinces. However, its metropolitan area covers 6,392 km2(2,468 sq mi), which extends into the two bordering provinces ofWest JavaandBanten.[50]TheGreater Jakartaarea includes three bordering regencies (Bekasi Regency,Tangerang RegencyandBogor Regency) and five adjacent cities (Bogor,Depok,Bekasi,TangerangandSouth Tangerang).\n\nJakarta is situated on the northwest coast ofJava, at the mouth of theCiliwung RiveronJakarta Bay, an inlet of theJava Sea. It is strategically located near theSunda Strait. The northern part of Jakarta is plain land, some areas of which are below sea level,[51]and subject to frequent flooding. The southern parts of the city are hilly. It is one of only two Asian capital cities located in the southern hemisphere (along withEast Timor'sDili). Officially, the area of the Jakarta Special District is 661.23 km2(255 sq mi) of land area and 6,977 km2(2,694 sq mi) of sea area.[52]TheThousand Islands, which are administratively a part of Jakarta, are located in Jakarta Bay, north of the city.\n\nJakarta lies in a low and flatalluvial plain, ranging from −2 to 91 m (−7 to 299 ft) with an average elevation of 8 m (26 ft)above sea levelwith historically extensive swampy areas. Some parts of the city have been constructed on reclaimed tidal flats that occur around the area.[53]Thirteen rivers flow through Jakarta. They areCiliwung River, Kalibaru,Pesanggrahan,Cipinang,Angke, Maja, Mookervart, Krukut, Buaran, West Tarum, Cakung, Petukangan,Sunter RiverandGrogol River.[54][55]They flow from thePuncakhighlands to the south of the city, then across the city northwards towards the Java Sea. TheCiliwung Riverdivides the city into the western and eastern districts. These rivers, combined with the wet season rains and insufficient drainage due to clogging, make Jakarta prone toflooding.\n\nMoreover, Jakarta is sinking about 5 to 10 cm (2.0 to 3.9 in) each year, and up to 20 cm (7.9 in) in the northern coastal areas. After a feasibility study, a ringdykeknown asGiant Sea Wall Jakartais under construction around Jakarta Bay to help cope with the threat from the sea. The dyke will be equipped with a pumping system and retention areas to defend against seawater and function as a toll road. The project is expected to be completed by 2025.[56]In January 2014, the central government agreed to build two dams in Ciawi, Bogor and a 1.2 km (0.75 mi) tunnel fromCiliwung RivertoCisadane Riverto ease flooding in the city.[57]Nowadays, a 1.2 km (0.75 mi), with capacity 60 m3(2,100 cu ft) per second, underground water tunnel between Ciliwung River and the East Flood Canal is being worked on to ease the Ciliwung River overflows.[58]In 2023, theNew York Timesreported that in some places Jakarta is sinking up to 12 inches (30 cm) annually.[59]\n\nEnvironmental advocates point out that subsidence is driven by the extraction of groundwater, much of it illegal. Furthermore, the government's lack of strict regulation amplifies the issue as many recently built high-rise buildings, corporations, and factories around Jakarta opt for illegally extracting groundwater. In fact, in a recent inspection of 80 buildings in Jalan Thamrin, a busy road lined with skyscrapers and shopping malls, 56 buildings had a groundwater pump, and 33 were pumping groundwater illegally.[60]This could be halted by stopping extraction (as the city of Tokyo has done), increasing efficiency, and finding other sources for water use. Moreover, increasing regulation through higher taxes or limiting groundwater pumping has proven to help cities like Shanghai, Tokyo, and San Jose relieve their subsidence issue.[61]The rivers of Jakarta are highly polluted and currently unsuitable for drinking water.[62]\n\nJakarta, faces significantair pollution, particularly during the dry season from August to December. Dry air during this period allows pollutants to remain suspended in the atmosphere for extended periods, contributing to poor air quality.[63][64]\n\nJakarta has architecturally significant buildings spanning distinct historical and cultural periods. Architectural styles reflect Malay, Sundanese, Javanese, Arabic, Chinese, and Dutch influences.[65]External influences inform the architecture of the Betawi house. The houses were built of nangka wood (Artocarpus integrifolia) and comprised three rooms. The shape of the roof is reminiscent of the traditionalJavanese joglo.[66]Additionally, the number of registered cultural heritage buildings has increased.[67]\n\nColonial buildings and structures include those that were constructed during the colonial period. The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: theDutch Golden Age(17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century – 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings, and offices, mostly concentrated in theJakarta Old TownandCentral Jakarta. Architects such as J.C. Schultze andEduard Cuypersdesigned some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works includeJakarta Art Building, the Indonesia Supreme Court Building andMinistry of FinanceBuilding, while Cuypers designedBank Indonesia MuseumandMandiri Museum. In the early 20th century, most buildings were built inNeo-Renaissancestyle. By the 1920s, the architectural taste had begun to shift in favour ofrationalismandmodernism, particularlyart decoarchitecture. The elite suburbMenteng, developed during the 1910s, was the city's first attempt at creating ideal and healthy housing for the middle class. The original houses had a longitudinal organisation, with overhanging eaves, large windows, and open ventilation, all practical features for a tropical climate.[68]These houses were developed by N.V. de Bouwploeg, and established byP.A.J. Moojen.\n\nAfter independence, the process of nation-building in Indonesia and demolishing the memory of colonialism was as important as the symbolic building of arterial roads, monuments, and government buildings. TheNational Monumentin Jakarta, designed by Sukarno, is Indonesia's beacon of nationalism. In the early 1960s, Jakarta provided highways and super-scale cultural monuments as well asSenayan Sports Stadium. Theparliament buildingfeatures a hyperbolic roof reminiscent of German rationalist and Corbusian design concepts.[69]Built-in 1996,Wisma 46soars to a height of 262 m (860 ft) and its nib-shaped top celebrates technology and symbolises stereoscopy.\n\nThe urban construction boom continued during the 21st century. TheGolden Triangle of Jakartais one of the fastest evolvingCBD's in the Asia-Pacific region.[70]According toCTBUHandEmporis, there are 88 skyscrapers that reach or exceed 150 m (490 ft), which puts the city in thetop 10 of world rankings.[71]It has more buildings taller than 150 metres than any other Southeast Asian orSouthern Hemispherecities.\n\nMost landmarks, monuments, and statues in Jakarta were begun in the 1960s during theSukarnoera, then completed in theSuhartoera, while some date from the colonial period. Although many of the projects were completed after his presidency, Sukarno, who was an architect, is credited for planning Jakarta's monuments and landmarks, as he desired the city to be the beacon of a powerful new nation. Among the monumental projects that were built, initiated, and planned during his administration are theNational Monument,Istiqlal mosque, theLegislature Building, and theGelora Bung Karnostadium. Sukarno also built many nationalistic monuments and statues in the capital city.[72]\n\nThe most famous landmark, which became the symbol of the city, is the 132 m-tall (433 ft) obelisk of theNational Monument(Monumen NasionalorMonas) in the centre ofMerdeka Square. On its southwest corner stands aMahabharata-themedArjunaWijayachariot statue and fountain. Further south throughJalan M.H. Thamrin, one of the main avenues, theSelamat Datangmonumentstands on the fountain in the centre of theHotel Indonesiaroundabout. Other landmarks include theIstiqlal Mosque,Jakarta Cathedral, and theImmanuel Church. The formerBatavia Stadhuis,Sunda Kelapaport in Jakarta Old Town is another landmark. TheAutograph TowerinCentral Jakarta, at 382.9 metres is thetallest building in Indonesia. The most recent landmark built is theJakarta International Stadium.\n\nSome of the statues and monuments are nationalist, such as theWest Irian Liberation Monument, theTugu Tani, theYouth statue, and theDirgantara Monument. Some statues commemorateIndonesian national heroes, such as theDiponegoroandKartinistatues in Merdeka Square. TheSudirmanandThamrinstatues are located on the streets bearing their names. There is also a statue ofSukarnoandHattaat the Proclamation Monument as well as at the entrance to Soekarno–Hatta International Airport.\n\nIn June 2011, Jakarta had only 10.5% green open spaces (Ruang Terbuka Hijau), although this grew to 13.94%. Public parks are included in public green open spaces.[73]There are about 300 integrated child-friendly public spaces (RPTRA) in the city in 2019.[74]As of 2014, 183 water reservoirs and lakes supported the greater Jakarta area.[75]\n\nJakarta experiences atropical monsoon climate(Köppen:Am) as classified by the system. The city'swet seasonspans most of the year, from October to May. Thedry seasonlasts from June to September, with each of these months receiving less than 100 millimetres (3.9 in) of rainfall on average. Situated in the western part of Java, Jakarta sees its highest rainfall in January and February, averaging 299.7 millimetres (11.8 in) per month, while the driest month is August, with an average rainfall of 43.2 millimetres (1.7 in).[95]\n\nEvery year faces recurring issues, such asfloodsandthunderstorms. Acyclonic vortexleads to moisture convergence over a large area, including western Java Island. Additionally, this vortex causes a mainly meridional monsoon flow, where near-surface winds blow almost perfectly from north to south over West Java. The impact of these predominant northerly winds hitting the rugged topography in southern West Java likely contributes to the increased convection that causes floods in Jakarta.[96]\n\nAverage temperatures are very high with moderate rainfall. During the day, the temperature usually hovers around 32 °C (89.6 °F) but drops to about 24 °C (75.2 °F) in the evening. These are average temperatures, and some days can be hotter. It's advisable to dress appropriately to handle the heat. January is the rainiest month, with over 300 millimetres (11.8 in) of precipitation, whereas August is the driest, with around 45 millimetres (1.8 in) of rainfall. The average temperature in the coldest month (February) is 27 °C (80.6 °F), and in the warmest month (October), it is 28 °C (82.4 °F). Sea temperatures range from 26.5 °C (79.7 °F) in August to 29.5 °C (85.1 °F) in March, April, November, and December.[97][98]Record low temperatures in Jakarta recorded 18.9 °C (66.0 °F), while the highest record reached 37.9 °C (100.2 °F).[99]\n\nJakarta attracts people from across Indonesia, often in search of employment. The 1961 census showed that 51% of the city's population was born in Jakarta.[105]Inward immigration tended to negate the effect of family planning programs.[39]The Ministry of Home Affairs (Kemendagri) tabulates its own data, which has improved since ID cards were required in the last decade, lists Jakarta's population at 11,261,595 at yearend 2021.\n\nBetween 1961 and 1980, the population of Jakarta doubled, and during the period 1980–1990, the city's population grew annually by 3.7%.[109]The 2010 census counted some 9.58 million people, well above government estimates.[110]The population rose from 4.5 million in 1970 to 9.5 million in 2010, counting only legal residents, while the population ofGreater Jakartarose from 8.2 million in 1970 to 28.5 million in 2010. As of 2014, the population of Jakarta stood at 10 million,[111]with a population density of 15,174 people/km2.[112][113]In 2014, the population ofGreater Jakartawas 30 million, accounting for 11% of Indonesia's overall population.[114]It is predicted to reach 35.6 million people by 2030 to become the world's biggestmegacity.[115]The gender ratio was 102.8 (males per 100 females) in 2010,[116]and 101.3 in 2014.[117]\n\nJakarta is pluralistic and religiously diverse, without a majority ethnic group. As of 2010, 36.17% of the city's population wereJavanese, 28.29%Betawi(locally established mixed race, cemented by diverse creole), 14.61%Sundanese, 6.62%Chinese, 3.42%Batak, 2.85%Minangkabau, 0.96%Malays,Indoand others 7.06%.[118]\n\nThe 'Betawi' (Orang Betawi, or 'people of Batavia') are immigrant descendants of the old city who became widely recognised as an ethnic group by the mid-19th century. They mostly descend from an eclectic mix of Southeast Asians brought or attracted to meet labour needs.[119]They are thus a Creole ethnic group who came from much of Indonesia. Over generations, most have intermarried with one or more ethnicities, especially people of Chinese, Arab, and European descent.[120]Most Betawis lived in the fringe zones with few Betawi-majority zones of central Jakarta.[121]It is thus a conundrum for some first generation Betawi people, especially multi-generational Jakarta residents, to identify as either their parents' ethnicity or Betawi since living in a Betawi-majority district and speaking more of that creole and adapting is a matter of preference for such families.\n\nA significantChinesecommunity has lived in Jakarta for many centuries. They traditionally reside around old urban areas, such asPinangsia,PIK,PluitandGlodok(Jakarta's Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in the oldChinatownsofSenenandJatinegara. As of 2001 they self-identified as being 5.5% of the population, which was thought of as under-reported;[122]this explains the 6.6% figure ten years later.\n\nThe Sumatran residents are diverse. According to the 2020 census, roughly 361,000Batak; 300,960Minangkabauand 101,370Malayslived in the city. The number of Batak people has grown in ranking, from eighth in 1930 to fifth in 2000.Toba Batakis the largest subset in Jakarta.[123]Working Minangkabau in the 1980s in high proportions were well-embedded merchants, artisans, doctors, teachers or journalists.[124][125]Minang merchantsare found in traditional markets, such as Tanah Abang and Senen.[126]\n\nIndonesianis the official and dominant language of Jakarta, while many elderly people speakDutchorChinese, depending on their upbringing.Englishis used for communication, especially in Central and South Jakarta.[127]Each of the ethnic groups uses their mother tongue at home, such asBetawi,Javanese, andSundanese. TheBetawi languageis distinct from those of theSundaneseorJavanese, forming itself as alanguage islandin the surrounding area. It is mostly based on the EastMalaydialect and enriched byloan wordsfromDutch,Portuguese,Sundanese,Javanese,Chinese, andArabic. Over time, many Betawi words and phrases became integrated into Indonesian as Jakartanslangand are used by most people regardless of their ethnic background. It is now popular not only in Jakarta, but all over Indonesia.\n\nThe Chinese in Jakarta mainly speak Indonesian and English due to a strict language ban during theSoehartoNew Orderera; older people may be fluent inHokkien dialectandMandarin, meanwhile the younger generation are fluent in Indonesian and English, some educated in Mandarin. With the recent urbanisation of Chinese communities from several rural areas in Indonesia, other Chinese dialects have been brought into the Chinese community in Jakarta, such asHakka,TeochewandCantonese.Hokkien, which is mainly from Sumatra (Medan,Bagansiapiapi,Batam) is mostly spoken in Northern Jakarta, such as inPantai Indah Kapuk,Pluit, andKelapa Gading, meanwhile Hakka and Teochew, which are derived from the Chinese communities inPontianakandSingkawang, are mainly spoken in West Jakarta, like inTamboraandGrogol Petamburan. The Batak in Jakarta mostly speak Indonesian, while the older generation tend to speak their native languages, such asBatak Toba,Mandailing, andKaro, depending on which ancestral towns and places inNorth Sumatrathey came from. The Minangkabau mainly speakMinangkabautogether with Indonesian.\n\nJakarta is home to numerous educational institutions. TheUniversity of Indonesia(UI) is the largest and oldest tertiary-level educational institution in Indonesia. It is a public institution with campuses in Salemba (Central Jakarta) and inDepok.[128]The three other public universities in Jakarta areSyarif Hidayatullah State Islamic University Jakarta, theState University of Jakarta(UNJ),[129]University of Pembangunan Nasional 'Veteran' Jakarta (UPN \"Veteran\" Jakarta),[130]and Universitas Terbuka orIndonesia Open University.[131]There is a vocational higher education,Jakarta State Polytechnic. Some major private universities in Jakarta areTrisakti University,The Christian University of Indonesia,Mercu Buana University,Tarumanagara University,Atma Jaya Catholic University of Indonesia,Pelita Harapan University, Pertamina University,[132]Bina Nusantara University,[133]Jayabaya University,[134]Persada Indonesia \"YAI\" University,[135]and Pancasila University.[136]\n\nSTOVIA(School tot Opleiding van Indische Artsen(School for Education of Native Physicians), now University of Indonesia) was the first college in Jakarta, established in 1851.[137]Jakarta houses many students from around Indonesia, many of whom reside in dormitories or home-stay residences. For basic education, a variety of primary and secondary schools are available, tagged with the public (national), private (national and bi-lingual national plus), andinternationallabels. Four of the major international schools are theBritish School Jakarta,Gandhi Memorial Intercontinental School, IPEKA Integrated Christian School,[138]and theJakarta Intercultural School.

They give priority to education, social welfare programs, and religious propagation.[146]Many Islamic organisations have headquarters in Jakarta, includingNahdlatul Ulama,Indonesian Ulema Council,Muhammadiyah,Indonesia Institute of Islamic Dawah, andJaringan Islam Liberal.\n\nTheRoman Catholiccommunity has aMetropolis, theArchdiocese of Jakartathat includesWest Javaand Banten provinces as part of the ecclesiastical province.

AlthoughBetawi peopleare Jakarta's indigenous community, the city's culture represents many languages and ethnic groups, favouring differences in religion, tradition, and linguistics, rather than a single, dominant culture. Jakarta is dominated byJavanese people, followed by Betawi people andSundanese people.\n\nTheBetawiculture is distinct from those of theSundaneseorJavanese, forming alanguage islandin the surrounding area. There is a significant Chinese influence in Betawi culture, reflected in the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets,firecrackers, and Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.\n\nSome festivals such as theJalan Jaksa Festival,Kemang Festival,Festival CondetandLebaran Betawiinclude efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to display performances.[180][181][182]Jakarta has several performing art centres, such as the classical concert hall Aula Simfonia Jakarta in Kemayoran,Taman Ismail Marzuki(TIM) art centre in Cikini,Gedung Kesenian Jakartanear Pasar Baru, Balai Sarbini in the Plaza Semanggi area,Bentara Budaya Jakartain the Palmerah area, Pasar Seni (Art Market) inAncol, and traditional Indonesian art performances at the pavilions of some provinces inTaman Mini Indonesia Indah.

TheJakarta City Hallat the south ofMerdeka Squarehouses the office of the governor and the vice governor and serves as the main administrative office.\n\nExecutive governance consists of five administrative cities (Indonesian:Kota Administrasi), each headed by amayor(walikota)and oneadministrative regency(Indonesian:Kabupaten Administrasi) headed by aregent(bupati). Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent is directly elected, Jakarta's mayors and regents are chosen by the governor.

It also assists the Jakarta Metropolitan Police during certain tasks, such as supporting security duringstate visits,VVIPsecurity, andriot control.\n\nThe Jakarta provincial government relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of its income. Local (non-central government) sources of revenue are incomes from various taxes such as vehicle ownership and vehicle transfer fees, among others.[215]The ability of the regional government to respond to Jakarta's many problems is constrained by limited finances.\n\nThe provincial government consistently runs a surplus of between 15 and 20% of planned spending, primarily because of delays in procurement and other inefficiencies.[216]Regular under-spending is a matter of public comment.[217]In 2013, the budget was around Rp 50 trillion ($US5.2 billion), equivalent to around $US380 per citizen. Spending priorities were on education, transport, flood control, environment, and social spending (such as health and housing).[218]Jakarta's regional budget (APBD) was Rp 77.1 trillion ($US5.92 billion), Rp 83.2 trillion ($US6.2 billion), and Rp 89 trillion ($US6.35 billion) for the year of 2017, 2018 and 2019 respectively.[219][220][221]\n\nJakarta consists of fiveKota Administratif(Administrative cities/municipalities), each headed by a mayor, and oneKabupaten Administratif(Administrative regency). Each city and regency is divided into districts (kecamatan). The administrative cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:\n\nThe only administrative regency (kabupaten) of Jakarta is theThousand Islands(Kepulauan Seribu), formerly adistrictwithin North Jakarta. It is a collection of 105 small islands located on the Java Sea. It is of high conservation value because of its unique ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycling, and windsurfing, are the primary tourist activities in this territory. The main mode of transportation between the islands is speed boats or small ferries.[227]\n\nThe province comprises three of Indonesia's 84 national electoral districts to elect members to thePeople's Representative Council. TheJakarta I Electoral Districtconsists of the administrative city of East Jakarta, and elects 6 members to the People's Representative Council.  TheJakarta II Electoral Districtconsists of the administrative cities of Central Jakarta and South Jskarta, together with all overseas voters, and elects 7 members to the People's Representative Council. TheJakarta III Electoral Districtconsists of the administrative cities of North Jakarta and West Jakarta, together with the Thousand Islands Regency, and elects 8 members to the People's Representative Council.[232]\n\nTo transform the city into a more liveable one, a ten-yearurban regenerationproject was undertaken, for Rp 571 trillion ($40.5 billion). The project aimed to develop infrastructure, including the creation of a better integrated public transit system and the improvement of the city's clean water and wastewater systems, housing, and flood control systems.[233]\n\nAs a metropolitan area of about 30 million people, Jakarta has a variety of transport systems.[234]Jakarta was awarded 2021 globalSustainable Transport Award(STA) for integrated public transportation system.[235]\n\nThe city prioritized development of road networks, which were mostly designed to accommodate private vehicles.[236]A notable feature of Jakarta's present road system is thetoll roadnetwork. Composed of aninnerandouterring roadand five toll roads radiating outwards, the network provides inner as well as outer city connections. An 'odd-even' policy limits road use to cars with either odd or even-numbered registration plates on a particular day as a transitional measure to alleviate traffic congestion until the future introduction ofelectronic road pricing.\n\nThere are many bus terminals in the city, from where buses operate on numerous routes to connect neighborhoods within the city limit, to other areas ofGreater Jakartaand to cities across the island ofJava. The biggest of the bus terminal isPulo Gebang Bus Terminal, which is arguably the largest of its kind in Southeast Asia.[237]Main terminus for long distance train services areGambirandPasar Senen.Whoosh High-speed railwaysis connecting Jakarta toBandungand another one is at the planning stage from Jakarta toSurabaya.\n\nAs of September 2023, Jakarta's public transport service coverage has reached 86 percent, which is targeted to increase to 95 percent. Rapid transit inGreater Jakartaconsists ofTransJakartabus rapid transit,Jakarta LRT,Jakarta MRT,KRL Commuterline,Jabodebek LRT, andSoekarno-Hatta Airport Rail Link. The city administration is building transit oriented development likeDukuh Atas TODandCSW-ASEAN TODin several area across Jakarta to facilitate commuters to transfer between different mode of public transportation.\n\nPrivately owned bus systems likeKopaja,MetroMini,Mayasari BaktiandPPDalso provide important services for Jakarta commuters with numerous routes throughout the city, many routes are/will replaced/replaced byMinitransandMetrotransbuses.[238]Pedicabsare banned from the city for causing traffic congestion.Bajajauto rickshaw provide local transportation in the back streets of some parts of the city.Angkotmicrobuses also play a major role in road transport of Jakarta.Taxicabsandojeks(motorcycle taxis) are available in the city. As of January 2023, about 2.6 million people use public transportation daily in Jakarta.[239]\n\nThe city administration has undertaken a project to build about 500 kilometers ofbicyclelanes. As of June 2021, Jakarta already has 63 kilometers of bicycle lanes, and another 101 kilometers will be added by the end of the year 2021.[240][241]\n\nSoekarno–Hatta International Airport(CGK) is the mainairportserving the Greater Jakarta area, whileHalim Perdanakusuma Airport(HLP) accommodates private andlow-costdomestic flights. Other airports in theJakarta metropolitan areaincludePondok Cabe Airportand an airfield on Pulau Panjang, part of theThousand Island archipelago.\n\nIndonesia's busiest and Jakarta's main seaportTanjung Priokserves many ferry connections to different parts of Indonesia. The old portSunda Kelapaonly accommodatepinisi, a traditional two-masted wooden sailing ship serving inter-island freight service in the archipelago.Muara Angkeis used as a public port toThousand Islands, while MarinaAncolis used as a tourist port.[242]\n\nFor payment method in public transportation (for KAI Commuter line, TransJakarta, LRT Jakarta, LRT Jabodebek, MRT Jakarta) already using cashless. Travelers can use Electronic money banking cards. The electronic money cards include those issued, namely:\n\nThe electronic banking cards is integrated cad can be accepted in KAI Commuter line, TransJakarta, LRT Jakarta, LRT Jabodebek, MRT Jakarta, eToll payment and parking payment. The electronic bank card can be bought in Bank Branch office or in e-commerce.\n\nFor the electronic banking card Top Up can be done at:\n\nJakarta has many of the country's best-equipped private and publichealthcare facilities. In 2012, the Governor of JakartaJoko Widodointroduced auniversal health careprogram, the 'Healthy Jakarta Card' (Kartu Jakarta Sehat, KJS).[246]In January 2014, the Indonesian government launched a universal health care system called theJaminan Kesehatan Nasional(JKN), which is run byBPJS Kesehatan.[247]KJS integrated into JKN,[248]and KJS cards were valid till 2018.[249]As of 2021, 85.55% of the people of Jakarta is covered by JKN.[250]\n\nGovernment-run hospitals are of a good standard but are often overcrowded. Government-run specialised hospitals includeDr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital,Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, as well as community hospitals andpuskesmas. Other options for healthcare services include private hospitals and clinics. The private healthcare sector has seen significant changes since the government began allowing foreign investment in the private sector in 2010. While some private facilities are run by nonprofit or religious organisations, most are for-profit. Hospital chains such asSiloam, Pondok Indah Hospital Group, Mayapada, Mitra Keluarga, Medika, Medistra, Ciputra, Radjak Hospital Group, RS Bunda Group, andHerminaoperate in the city.[251][252][253]\n\nTwo private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. Eighty per cent of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on theCitarum River, 70 km (43 mi) southeast of the city. The water supply was privatised by President Suharto in 1998 to the French companySuez Environnementand the British companyThames WaterInternational. Both companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the first seven years of the concessions had been lower than before, possibly because of substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005, tariffs were frozen, leading private water companies to cut down on investments.\n\nAccording to PALYJA, the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% (1998) to 65% (2010) in the western half of the concession.[254]According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004 but stagnated afterward.[255]However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: one study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005,[256]while another estimated it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011.[257]Those without access to piped water get water mostly from wells that are often salty and unsanitary. As of 2017, according to theMinistry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Jakarta had a crisis over clean water.[258]\n\nJakarta hosts foreignembassies. Jakarta also serves as the seat ofAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN) Headquarters and is ASEAN's diplomatic capital.[259]\n\nJakarta is a member of theAsian Network of Major Cities 21,C40 Cities Climate Leadership GroupandASEAN Smart Cities Network.\n\nJakarta signedsister cityagreements with other cities, includingCasablanca. To promote friendship between the two cities, the main avenue famous for its shopping and business centres was named after Jakarta's Moroccan sister city. No street in Casablanca is named after Jakarta. However, the Moroccan capital city of Rabat has an avenue named afterSukarno, Indonesia's first president, to commemorate his visit in 1960 and as a token of friendship.[260]\n\nJakarta's sister cities are:[261]\n\nJakarta has established a partnership withRotterdam, especially on integrated urban water management, including capacity-building and knowledge exchange.[262]This cooperation is mainly because both cities are dealing with similar problems; they lie in low-lying flat plains and are prone to flooding. Additionally, they have both implemented drainage systems involving canals, dams and pumps vital for both cities for below-sea-level areas.\n\nIn addition to its sister cities, Jakarta cooperates with:[261]",

West Jakarta is notself-governedand does not have acity council, hence it is not classified as a propermunicipality. It had a population of 2,281,945 at the 2010 Census[2]and 2,434,511 at the 2020 Census;[3]the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,611,515 (comprising 1,312,120 males and 1,299,395 females).[1]The administrative center of West Jakarta is at Puri Kembangan.\n\nWest Jakarta is bordered byTangerang RegencyandNorth Jakartato the north,Central Jakartato the east,South Jakartato the south, andTangerangcity to the west.\n\nWest Jakarta is famous for its Dutch colonial relics such as Town Hall Building (nowJakarta History MuseuminJakarta Old Town), Chinatown (Glodok) and also a number of old churches, mosques, and fortresses of early Dutch colonization inBataviaat that time.\n\nWest Jakarta Administrative City (Kota Administrasi Jakarta Barat) is subdivided into eightdistricts(kecamatan), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census[2]and 2020 Census,[3]together with the official estimates as at mid 2023:[1]The table also includes the number ofadministrative villagesin each district (all classed as urbankelurahan), together with their names and post codes.\n\nAfter South Jakarta, West Jakarta is now designed to become a new business district for the Jakarta area and beyond. Particularly inKembangan District, malls, entertainment centers, shopping centers, office centers, hospitals and schools have been built. This area has become a strategic area because it is passed by the circuit of the Jakarta Outer Ring Road (Jalan Lingkar Luar Jakarta).\n\nLike the rest of the city, public school system are available in West Jakarta. State schools such as SDN 01, SDN 03, SMPN 45, SMPN 169, SMPN 22, SMPN 32, SMAN 57, SMAN 65 and many more are located at West Jakarta. Private schools, that may be based on religion, such as Christian-based Bukit Sion International School, BPK Penabur Schools, and Islamic-based school such as Al-Azhar are also located on West Jakarta.\n\nWest Jakarta is a home to numerous college and universities, such asBina Nusantara University,Mercu Buana University,Trisakti University,Tarumanagara University, Podomoro University, and many more. TheTelkom Institute of Technology Jakarta, a private university, was established in 2021 (formerly Jakarta Telkom Academy - 2002).\n\nAs Jakarta Old Town is located in West Jakarta, West Jakarta boosts some of the most famous museums of Jakarta such asJakarta History Museum,Wayang Museum, andMuseum Bank Indonesia.

    "content": "\n\nW, orw, is the twenty-thirdletterof theLatin alphabet, used in themodern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English isdouble-u,[in 1]pluraldouble-ues.[1][2]\n\nDouble-u, whose name reflects stages in the letter's evolution when it was considered two of the same letter, a double U, is the only modern English letter whose name has more than one syllable.[in 2]It is also the only English letter whose name is not pronounced with any of the sounds that the letter typically makes in words, with the exception ofHfor some speakers.\n\nSome speakers shorten the name \"double u\" into \"dub-u\" or just \"dub\"; for example,University of Wisconsin,University of Washington,University of Wyoming,University of Waterloo,University of the Western CapeandUniversity of Western Australiaare all known colloquially as \"U Dub\", and the automobile companyVolkswagen, abbreviated \"VW\", is sometimes pronounced \"V-Dub\".[3]The fact that many website URLs require a \"www.\" prefix has been influential in promoting these shortened pronunciations.[citation needed]\n\nIn otherWest Germanic languages, its name is monosyllabic: GermanWe/veː/, Dutchwee/ʋeː/. In many languages, its name literally means \"double v\": Portugueseduplo vê,[in 3]Spanishdoble ve(though it can be spelleduve doble),[4][in 4]Frenchdouble vé,Icelandictvöfalt vaff,Czechdvojité vé,Estoniankaksisvee,Finnishkaksois-vee, etc.\n\nTheclassical Latin alphabet, from which the modern European alphabets derived, did not have the \"W\" character. The \"W\" sounds were represented by the Latin letter \"V\" (at the time, not yet distinct from \"U\").\n\nThe sounds/w/(spelled⟨V⟩) and/b/(spelled⟨B⟩) ofClassical Latindeveloped into thevoiced bilabial fricative/β/betweenvowelsinEarly Medieval Latin. Therefore,⟨V⟩no longer adequately represented thevoiced labial-velar approximantsound/w/ofGermanic phonology.\n\nTheGermanic/w/phoneme was, therefore, written as⟨VV⟩or⟨uu⟩(⟨u⟩and⟨v⟩becoming distinct only by theEarly Modern period) by the earliest writers ofOld EnglishandOld High German, in the 7th or 8th centuries.[8]Gothic(notLatin-based), by contrast, had simply used a letter based on the GreekΥfor the same sound in the 4th century. The digraph⟨VV⟩/⟨uu⟩was also used inMedieval Latinto represent Germanic names, including Gothic ones likeWamba.\n\nIt is from this⟨uu⟩digraphthat the modern name \"double U\" derives. The digraph was commonly used in the spelling of Old High German but only in the earliest texts in Old English, where the/w/sound soon came to be represented by borrowing therune⟨ᚹ⟩, adapted as the Latin letterwynn:⟨ƿ⟩. In earlyMiddle English, following the 11th-centuryNorman Conquest,⟨uu⟩regained popularity; by 1300, it had taken wynn's place in common use.\n\nScribal realisation of the digraph could look like a pair of Vs whose branches crossed in the middle: both forms (separate and crossed) appear, for instance, in the \"running text\" (in Latin) of theBayeux tapestryin proper names such as EDVVARDVS and VVILLELMVS (or the same with crossed Vs). Another realisation (common inroundhand,kurrentandblackletter) takes the form of an⟨n⟩whose rightmost branch curved around, as in a cursive⟨v⟩(viz.w.{\\displaystyle {\\mathfrak {w}}.})[5][6]It was used up to the nineteenth century in Britain and continues to be familiar in Germany.[in 5]\n\nThus, the shift from the digraph⟨VV⟩to the distinct ligature⟨W⟩was gradual and was only apparent inabecedaria, explicit listings of all individual letters. It was probably considered a separate letter by the 14th century in bothMiddle EnglishandMiddle Germanorthography. However, it remained an outsider, not really considered part of the Latin alphabet proper, as expressed byValentin Ickelshamerin the 16th century, who complained that:\n\nPoorwis so infamous and unknown that many barely know either its name or its shape, not those who aspire to being Latinists, as they have no need of it, nor do the Germans, not even the schoolmasters, know what to do with it or how to call it; some call itwe, [... others] call ituu, [...] theSwabianscall itauwawau[9]\n\nInMiddle High German(and possibly already in late Old High German), the West Germanic phoneme/w/became realized as[v]; this is why, today, the German⟨w⟩represents that sound.\n\nEnglish uses⟨w⟩to represent/w/. There are also a number of words beginning with a written⟨w⟩that issilentin most dialects before a (pronounced)⟨r⟩, remaining from usage inOld Englishin which the⟨w⟩was pronounced:wreak,wrap,wreck,wrench,wroth,wrinkle, etc. Certain dialects ofScottish Englishstill distinguish this digraph.⟨w⟩represents a vowel sound,/oʊ/, in the wordpwn, and in the Welsh loanwordscwmandcrwth, it retains the Welsh pronunciation,/ʊ/.⟨w⟩is also used in digraphs:⟨aw⟩/ɔː/,⟨ew⟩/(j)uː/,⟨ow⟩/aʊ,oʊ/, wherein it is usually an orthographicallographof⟨u⟩in final positions. It is thefifteenth most frequently used letterin the English language, with a frequency of about 2.56% in words.\n\nIn Europe languages with⟨w⟩in native words are in a central-western European zone between Cornwall and Poland: English,German,Low German,Dutch,Frisian,Welsh,Cornish,Breton,Walloon,Polish,Kashubian,Sorbian,Wymysorys,ResianandScandinavian dialects. German, Polish, Wymysorys and Kashubian use it for thevoiced labiodental fricative/v/(with Polish, related Kashubian and Wymysorys usingŁfor/w/, except in conservative and some eastern Polish speech, where Ł still represents thedark Lsound.), and Dutch uses it for/ʋ/. Unlike its use in other languages, the letter is used inWelshandCornishto represent the vowel/u/as well as the related approximant consonant/w/.\n\nThe following languages historically used⟨w⟩for/v/in native words, but later replaced it by⟨v⟩:Swedish,Finnish,Czech,Slovak,Latvian,Lithuanian,Estonian,Ukrainian ŁatynkaandBelarusian Łacinka. It is also used in modern systems ofRomanization of Belarusianfor the letter⟨ў⟩, for example in the BGN/PCGN[10]system, in contrast to the letter⟨ŭ⟩, which is used in theInstruction on transliteration of Belarusian geographical names with letters of Latin script.\n\nIn Swedish and Finnish, traces of this old usage may still be found in proper names. InHungarianremains in some aristocratic surnames, e.g.Wesselényi.\n\nModernGerman dialectsgenerally have only[v]or[ʋ]for West Germanic/w/, but[w]or[β̞]is still heard allophonically for⟨w⟩, especially in the clusters⟨schw⟩,⟨zw⟩, and⟨qu⟩. Some Bavarian dialects preserve a \"light\" initial[w], such as inwuoz(Standard Germanweiß[vaɪs]'[I] know'). The Classical Latin[β]is heard in the Southern German greetingServus('hello' or 'goodbye').\n\nInDutch,⟨w⟩became alabiodental approximant/ʋ/(with the exception of words with -⟨eeuw⟩, which have/eːβ/, or other diphthongs containing -⟨uw⟩). In many Dutch-speaking areas, such asFlandersandSuriname, the/β/pronunciation (or in some areas a/ɥ/pronunciation, e.g. Belgian-Dutchwater/'ɥaːtər/\"water\",wit/ɥɪt/\"white\",eeuw/eːɥ/\"century\", etc.) is used at all times.\n\nInFinnish,⟨w⟩is sometimes seen as a variant of⟨v⟩and not a separate letter, but it is a part of official alphabet. It is, however, recognized and maintained in the spelling of some old names, reflecting an earlier German spelling standard, and in some modern loan words. In all cases, it is pronounced/ʋ/. The first edition of theKalevalahad its title spelledKalewala.\n\nInDanish,NorwegianandSwedish,⟨w⟩is named double-v and not double-u. In these languages, the letter only exists in old names, loanwords and foreign words. (Foreign words are distinguished from loanwords by having a significantly lower level of integration in the language.) It is usually pronounced/v/, but in some words of English origin, it may be pronounced/w/.[11][12]The letter was officially introduced in the Danish and Swedish alphabets as late as 1980 and 2006, respectively, despite having been in use for much longer. It had been recognized since the conception of modern Norwegian with the earliest official orthography rules of 1907.[13]⟨W⟩was earlier seen as a variant of⟨v⟩, and⟨w⟩as a letter (double-v) is still commonly replaced by⟨v⟩in speech (e.g.WCbeing pronounced asVC,wwwasVVV,WHOasVHO, etc.). The two letters were sorted as equals before⟨w⟩was officially recognized, and that practice is still recommended when sorting names in Sweden.[14]In modern slang, some native speakers may pronounce⟨w⟩more closely to the origin of the loanword than the official/v/pronunciation.\n\nMultiple dialects of Swedish and Danish use the sound, however. In Denmark, notably inJutland, the northern half uses it extensively intraditional dialect, and in multiple places in Sweden. It is used in southern Swedish; for example, the words \"wesp\" (wisp) and \"wann\" (water) are traditionally used inHalland.[15]In northern and western Sweden, there are also dialects with/w/.Elfdalianis a good example, which is one of many dialects where theOld Norse differencebetween v (/w/) and f (/v/or/f/) is preserved. Thus, \"warg\" from Old Norse \"vargr\", but \"åvå\" from Old Norse \"hafa\".\n\nIn the alphabets of most modern Romance languages,⟨w⟩is used mostly in foreign names and words recently borrowed (Italianil watt, Spanishel kiwi). In Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese,[w]is a non-syllabic variant of/u/, spelled⟨u⟩. In Italian, while the letter⟨w⟩is not considered part of the standardItalian alphabet, the character is often used in place ofViva(hooray for...), generally in the form in which the branches of the Vs cross in the middle, at least inhandwriting(in fact it could be considered amonogram).[16]The same symbol written upside down indicatesabbasso(down with...). In French,⟨w⟩is also used mostly in foreign names and words recently borrowed such aswagonorweek(-)end, but in the first case it is pronounced[v](because of its German origin; except in Belgium, where it is pronounced [w]) and in the second[w]. In most northern French dialects, the former⟨w⟩turned finally to⟨v⟩, but still exists as a remnant in the place-names ofRomance Flanders,Picardie,Artois,Champagne,Romance Lorraineand sometimes elsewhere (Normandy,Île-de-France), and in the surnames from the same regions. Walloon as it sounds conserves the⟨w⟩pronounced[w]. The digraph⟨ou⟩is used to render⟨w⟩in rare French words such asouest\"west\" and to spell Arabic names transliterated-wiin English, but-ouiin French (compare Arabic surnameBadawi/ Badaoui). In all these languages, as in Scandinavian languages mentioned above, the letter is named \"double v\" (French/dubləve/, Spanish/'dɔble'uβe/) though in Belgium the name/we/is also used.\n\nInIndonesian, the letter \"w\" is calledwé. The letter names in Indonesian are always the same with the sounds they produce, especially the consonants.\n\nTheJapanese languageuses \"W\", pronounceddaburu, as an ideogram meaning \"double\".[17]It is also used in internet slang to indicate laughter (likeLOL), derived from the wordwarau(笑う, meaning \"to laugh\").\n\nIn Italian, while the letter⟨w⟩is not considered part of the standardItalian alphabet, the character is often used in place ofViva(hooray for...), generally in the form in which the branches of the Vs cross in the middle, at least inhandwriting(in fact, it could be considered amonogram).[16]The same symbol written upside down indicatesabbasso(down with...).\n\nIn theKokborok language,⟨w⟩represents theopen-mid back rounded vowel/ɔ/.\n\nIn Turkey, the use of the⟨w⟩was banned between 1928 and 2013[18][19]which was a problem for theKurdish population in Turkeyas the⟨w⟩was a letter of theKurdish alphabet.[20]The use of the letter⟨w⟩in the wordNewroz, the Kurdish new year, was forbidden,[21]and names which included the letter were not able to be used.[18][22]In 2008, a court inGaziantepreasoned the use of the letter⟨w⟩would incite civil unrest.[21]\n\nInVietnamese,⟨w⟩is calledvê đúporvê kép(lit.'double V'), from the Frenchdouble vé. It is not included in the standardVietnamese alphabet, but it is often used as a substitute forqu-inliterary dialectand very informal writing.[23][24]It's also commonly used for abbreviatingƯin formal documents, for exampleTrung Ươngis abbreviated as TW[25]even in official documents and document ID number, derived from theVietnamese Telex input methodthat usually interpret a single \"w\" into Vietnamese character \"ư\".[26]\n\n\"W\" is the 24th letter in theModern Filipino Alphabetand has its English name. However, in the old Filipino alphabet,Abakada, it was the 19th letter and had the name \"wah\".[is that 'h' a glottal stop?][27]\n\nInWasho, lower-case⟨w⟩represents a typical/w/sound, while upper-case⟨W⟩represents avoicelessw sound, like the difference between Englishweatherandwhetherfor those who maintain the distinction.\n\nIn theInternational Phonetic Alphabet, ⟨w⟩ is used for thevoiced labial-velar approximant.\n\n\n\n\n\nInformational notes\n\nCitations",

    "content": "Tip:Are you anon-native English speaker? I have just finished creating aWeb Appfor people who enjoy learning by reading. Make sure to check it out; there's a lot of free content.\n\nPronunciation of the letterein French is ambiguous. There are four ways to pronounce it: /e/ (as “e” in “hey”, called “closed e”), /ɛ/ (as “e” in “bet”, called “open e”), /ə/ (as “a” in the name “Tina”, called “schwa”), or it can remain silent; however, it may also form part of a larger group of letters where the pronunciation may be different.\n\nIn this post, we shall learn some basic rules you have to know if you want to be understood and sound natural in French.\n\nThe diacritical marks (accents) exist only to distinguish cases where the pronunciation differs from the one established by the standard rules for the letter “e” (you can find these in thenext section). Here they are:\n\nËwith diaeresisis the easiest case to deal with. The diaeresis (the two dots) signifies that the underlying “e” is pronounced as /ɛ/ (as “e” in “bet”, i.e. the opene), no matter what comes around it, and is used in groups of vowels that would otherwise be pronounced differently.\n\nFor exampleNoël(Christmas) is pronounced /nɔɛl/ (naw-ell), whereas “noel” (a non-existing word) would be pronounced /nœl/ (/œ/ sounds approximately like “ir” in “bird” in British English with lips rounded or like German “ö”). This diacritical mark can appear also above other vowels. For instance,naïveis pronounced /naiv/ (nah-eev), whereasnaive(a non-existing word) would be pronounced /nɛv/ (nev).\n\nÈwith the grave accentdenotes the pronunciation /ɛ/ (as “e” in “bet”, that is, the opene). It is used to make it clear that an “e” is not silent and isn’t reduced to /ə/ (uh). For example, in the wordpère(father), “pè” is an open syllable (it ends with a vowel), so if the word were spelled “pere”, the expected pronunciation would be /pəʁ/ (puhr). To denote the correct pronunciation /pɛʁ/ (perr), we have to use an “è”.\n\nThe letter “è” also commonly appears in verb conjugation. For example,acheter(to buy) is pronounced /aʃəte/ (ah-shuh-teh) or /aʃte/ (ash-teh); the middle “e” is reduced because it is the last letter of the syllable (the syllables area-che-ter). However, when the verb is conjugated in the singular, it is pronounced /aʃɛt/ (ah-shet). The grave accent has to be used here to mark the correct pronunciation; hence we havej’achète,tu achètes,il achète, not “j’achete, tu achetes, il achete”.\n\nThis happens with many other verbs, eg.amener – j’amène(“take”),lever – je lève(“lift”),peler – je pèle(“peel”).\n\nÉwith the acute accentdenotes the pronunciation /e/ (as “e” in “hey”; somewhere between “e” in “bet” and “ee” in “see”). It used wherever the pronunciation requires this sound, but the general rules would dictate otherwise if no accent were used. Remember not to write “é” when the pronunciation is already established by the rules, most importantly the endings “-ez” (e.g.vous avez) and “-er” in infinitives (e.g.aimer).\n\nÊwith the circumflex accentmarks an “e” after which originally some other letter was written (usually an S), but this letter is no longer present in its modern spelling. For example,être(to be) was originally writtenestre, which is the link to its Latin origin,esse, which you can still see in English words like “essential”.\n\nAnyway, since “ê” is basically just a form of writing “es”, which makes the syllable closed (see thenext section), “ê” is usually pronounced /ɛ/ (as “e” in “bet”). By imagining “es” instead of “ê”, we can often deduce the meaning of unknown words; for example,forêt= forest,fête= “feste” = fest(ival);intérêt= interest and many others. The circumflex accent is used in the very same sense also for other vowels, for exampleîle= isle,hôte= “hoste” = host,hâte= haste.\n\nBy the way, have you already seen mybrand new web app for non-native speakers of English?

    "content": "\n\nE, ore, is the fifthletterand the secondvowel letterof theLatin alphabet, used in themodern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English ise(pronounced/ˈiː/); plurales,Es, orE's.[1]\n\nIt is the most commonly used letter in many languages, includingCzech,Danish,Dutch,English,French,German,Hungarian,Latin,Latvian,Norwegian,Spanish, andSwedish.[2][3][4][5][6]\n\nIn English, the name of the letter is the \"long E\" sound, pronounced/ˈiː/. In most other languages, its name matches the letter's pronunciation inopen syllables.\n\nThe Latin letter 'E' differs little from its source, theGreekletterepsilon, 'Ε'. This in turn comes from theSemiticletterhê, which has been suggested to have started as a praying or calling human figure (hillul, 'jubilation'), and was most likely based on a similarEgyptian hieroglyphthat indicated a different pronunciation.\n\nIn Semitic, the letter represented/h/(and/e/in foreign words); in Greek,hêbecame the letterepsilon, used to represent/e/. The various forms of theOld Italic scriptand theLatin alphabetfollowed this usage.\n\nAlthoughMiddle Englishspelling used⟨e⟩to represent long and short/e/, theGreat Vowel Shiftchanged long/eː/(as inmeorbee) to/iː/while short/ɛ/(as inmetorbed) remained amid vowel. In unstressed syllables, this letter is usually pronounced either as/ɪ/or/ə/. In other cases, the letter issilent, generally at the end of words likequeue.\n\nIn the orthography of many languages, it represents either[e],[e̞],[ɛ], or some variation (such as anasalizedversion) of these sounds, often with diacritics (as:⟨eêéèëēĕěẽėẹęẻ⟩) to indicate contrasts. Less commonly, as in French, German, orSaanich,⟨e⟩represents amid-central vowel/ə/.Digraphswith⟨e⟩are common to indicate eitherdiphthongsormonophthongs, such as⟨ea⟩or⟨ee⟩for/iː/or/eɪ/in English,⟨ei⟩for/aɪ/inGerman, and⟨eu⟩for/ø/inFrenchor/ɔɪ/in German.\n\nTheInternational Phonetic Alphabetuses ⟨e⟩ for theclose-mid front unrounded vowelor themid front unrounded vowel.\n\nE is the most common (or highest-frequency) letter in the English language alphabet and several otherEuropean languages,[7]which has implications in bothcryptographyanddata compression. This makes it a harder letter to use when writinglipograms.\n\n\n\nInBritish Sign Language(BSL), the letter 'e' is signed by extending the index finger of the right hand touching the tip of index on the left hand, with all fingers of left hand open.",

    "content": "\n\nEE(formerlyEverything Everywhere) is a Britishmobile network operatorandinternet service provider, and a brand ofBT Consumer, a division ofBT Group. It was established in 2010 and is thesecond-largest mobile network operator in the United Kingdom, with 21.2 million customers as of September 2022.[2]\n\nIt was originally formed in 2010 as a 50:50joint venturebetweenDeutsche Telekomand France Télécom (nowOrange S.A.) following the merger ofT-Mobile UKandOrange UK, their respective businesses in the UK; the former brands were phased out in 2015. The name was shortened to EE when the company concurrently launched the UK's first4Gmobile network in 2012. EE was acquired by BT in 2016 and became a new consumer division within the wider group.\n\nEE has its headquarters in London, England, as well as hubs inBristol,Darlington,Sunderland,Greenock,Merthyr Tydfil,North Tyneside,PlymouthandLeeds. As of November 2016[update], EE's4Gnetwork coverage reached more than 99% of the UK population, with double speed 4G reaching 80%, while EE's3Gnetwork reached 98% of the population until its closure at the start of 2024.[3][4][5]\n\nDeutsche Telekomand France Télécom (nowOrange S.A.) announced plans to merge their respective UK ventures –T-Mobile UKandOrange UK– on 8 September 2009. T-Mobile's UK unit had its origins inMercury Communications, formed in 1989, and Orange had launched its services in 1994 while under the ownership ofHutchison Whampoa.\n\nThe initial planning suggested a joint revenue of around £7.7 billion for 2008, with savings via synergies expected to total \"over £445 million annually from 2014 onwards\".[6]The two companies also announced an expected investment of \"£600 to £800 million in integration costs\".[6]A press release outlined a vision for the two brands, stating that \"the T-Mobile UK and Orange UK brands will be maintained separately for 18 months\".[6]The merger was cleared by theEuropean Commissionon 1 March 2010;[7]no new company was formed, but instead T-Mobile (UK) Limited was renamed to Everything Everywhere Limited in July.[8]\n\nThe 50:50joint venturewas announced as completed on 1 April 2010,[9]and the name Everything Everywhere was announced on 11 May 2010.[10][11]On the same day the company confirmed that \"roaming across both networks [would be] due later in that year, at no additional cost to the customer\" and further emphasised the separation of the brands, saying that each brand would maintain \"its own shops, marketing campaigns, propositions and service centres\".[12]\n\nThe companies' network sharing plans (allowing Orange customers to utilise T-Mobile's 2G signal and vice versa) were released to customers in October 2010. The \"switch-on\" was rolled out utilising an opt-in page on each brand's website. However, the rollout did not initially include automatic network roaming mid-call or the two brands' 3G services.[13]\n\nIn January 2011, Everything Everywhere andBarclaycardannounced that they would be jointly introducing the UK's first contactless mobile payments system for consumers by early summer 2011.[14]Everything Everywhere expanded its contactless mobile payments arm by announcing a deal withMastercardin August 2012 that would see the two companies work together on introducingnear-field communication(NFC) technology and other mobile payment technologies into the UK.[15]Soon after, Everything Everywhere sustained its involvement in the future of NFC technology in the UK by announcing a joint venture between itself,VodafoneandO2. The joint venture was designed to be a \"single point of contact\" for all those involved in increasing the adoption of NFC for mobile payments in the UK.[16]\n\nOn 18 July 2011, Tom Alexander announced unexpectedly that he would step down as CEO. Alexander had joined Orange in 2008 and had led the company since its formation in July 2010. It was announced that he would leave his post on 31 August 2011 and would be replaced by Olaf Swantee, who had held the position of Executive VP of European Activities and Sourcing for France Télécom in addition to being a member of EE's board. Alexander said that he would remain with the company throughout the remainder of 2011 and continue to advise Swantee in his new role.[17]Swantee is seen as having done an exceptional job in leading the group through the challenges of rebranding and the launch of a new technology, and was named the mobile industry's person of the year in 2013[18]as a result.\n\nIn November 2011, Everything Everywhere announced plans to cut a further 550 back office staff, with its sites inBristol,Darlington,Hatfield, andPaddingtonaffected.[19][20]\n\nIn April 2012, the T-Mobile network inNorthern Irelandwas switched off, meaning that customers there roamed onto Orange. Later,[when?]most T-Mobile sites were turned back on as EE has amast sharing agreement with 3.\n\nEverything Everywhere announced on 22 August 2012 that it would introduce a third brand as part of a future4Glaunch to sit alongside T-Mobile and Orange, and that Everything Everywhere would continue as the company's legal name.[21]Further speculation commenced on 7 September 2012 when the company announced details of a press conference on the morning of 11 September 2012, the earliest date set by Ofcom to launch 4G services.[22]It was also noted that this date was only 24 hours earlier than the expected launch of the latest generation ofiPhone(the iPhone 5), thereby arousing suspicion that the new iPhone would support 4G and that Everything Everywhere would launch its service on this widely anticipated handset.[23]Other commentators suggested that theHTC One XLwould be the first handset to launch utilising Everything Everywhere's 4G network.[24]The handsets that the company initially launched on EE are theiPhone 5(iOS), HTC One XL (Android),Samsung Galaxy S III(Android),Samsung Galaxy Note II(Android),Huawei Ascend P1(Android),Nokia Lumia 920(Windows Phone),Nokia Lumia 820(Windows Phone). The company also announced that they would be using two 4G mobile broadband devices manufactured byHuawei- theE589 Mobile Wi-Fi deviceand E392 mobile broadband dongle.[25]\n\nOn 11 September 2012, it was announced that the EE brand would be used to identify its network on all of the company's devices (EE, T-Mobile and Orange), alongside its 4G service and the company's fibre optic broadband roll-out. The brand was described by EE asThe Super Fast Brand. It was also confirmed that all ex-T-Mobile and ex-Orange shops would be re-branded EE overnight, but mobile products would continue to be sold under those brands inside the stores.[26]The company's legal name changed to EE Limited on 2 September 2013.[8]\n\nOn 30 October 2012, it was announced that its Orange broadband service would be rebranded as EE, and the company would be launching a newfibre-opticbroadband service, using a Bright Box router and Openreach GEA.[27]The change took effect on 5 November 2012 through a firmware upgrade that replaced the Orange branding with EE on customers' router web interface.[28]On 6 November 2012, it was announced that EE had exclusively partnered with mobile payments companyiZettle. The agreement allowed EE to sell the company's mini debit/credit card readers which allow small business customers to make payments using their mobile phones. The devices initially went on sale in 297 EE stores and via EE's telesales channel.[29]\n\nIn March 2014, EE began to phase out the T-Mobile and Orange brands in the UK, removing these products from their website and retail stores. However, these brands were still available via telesales and through third-party retail channels. The phase out was completed in March 2015, with new connections and upgrades only available on EE branded services.[30]\n\nDuring 2014,Deutsche TelekomandOrange S.A.were reported to be considering options to sell EE or divest it through aninitial public offering.[31]On 15 December 2014,BTconfirmed it had entered into exclusive talks to buy EE for £12.5 billion.[32]On 5 February 2015, BT confirmed it would be acquiring EE for £12.5 billion; subject to regulatory approval,[33]and received final unconditional approval by theCompetition and Markets Authorityon 15 January 2016.[34]The deal was completed on 29 January 2016 with Deutsche Telekom now owning 12% of BT, while Orange owns 4%.[35]\n\nOn 1 February 2016, BT announced that EE will become a new consumer division within the wider group, alongsideBT Consumer.[36][37]It will serve customers with mobile services, broadband and TV, and also continue to deliver the Emergency Services Network contract which was awarded to EE in late 2015. EE's business division was brought together withBT Businessand the UK-focused operations ofBT Global Servicesto form a new BT Business and Public Sector division with around £5bn of revenues. Another new division, BT Wholesale and Ventures, comprised theBT Wholesaledivision along with EE'sMVNObusiness as well as some specialist businesses such as Fleet, Payphones and Directories. Gerry McQuade, currently Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Business at EE, will be its CEO.[36][37][38]\n\nOn 28 July 2017, BT announced organisational changes to \"simplify its operating model, strengthen accountabilities and accelerate its transformation\" and involves bringing together its BT Consumer and EE divisions into a new unified BT Consumer division that will operate across three brands – BT, EE, andPlusnet.[39][40][41][42]This took effect on 1 April 2018.[43]\n\nEE has main offices in London,Bristol,[44]Darlington,Doxford,Greenock,Merthyr Tydfil,North Tyneside,PlymouthandLeeds.[45][46][47]In June 2016, it was announced that EE was making preparations to move from its offices in Paddington toBT Centreat the end of year, as part of BT's plans to save £360 million a year following its acquisition of EE.[48][49]The move began in November 2016.[50]\n\nIn November 2010, EE announced the opening of six \"dual-branded\" shops: three were led by T-Mobile and three by Orange, and each promoted the other brand's products.[51]The company expanded further in early 2011.[52]Five new shops had an Everything Everywhere–branded fascia, although they represented and sold both T-Mobile and Orange.[52]During the same quarter, the company also launched a number of Orange concessions in selectedHMVshops. These were designed to operate as normal Orange retail shops, although with an expected lower footfall and designed to cater for HMV's younger consumers.[52]The company removed these concessions from HMV shortly before the re-brand, with their approximately 100 staff transferred to local shops.[53]\n\nEE had 700 shops in the UK after the re-branding of existing Orange, T-Mobile, and Everything Everywhere shops in October 2012.[54]In January 2013, it was announced that EE would close 78 shops, with no job losses, because in several locations there were two on the same street, often close together.[55]In January 2014, it was announced that EE would close a further 76 duplicated shops and there would be 50 new ones, including 30 franchise outlets, estimated to create 350 jobs. The franchise outlets would grow to 100 by the end of the year, including the transfer of 45 directly managed shops to franchise partners. The move saw its number of shops reduce from 600 to 574 (including the 100 franchise outlets).[56][57][58]\n\nIn September 2014, it was announced that following the collapse ofPhones 4uin the UK, EE would acquire 58 of its shops for £2.5 million in a deal with its administrators,PricewaterhouseCoopers. The deal safeguarded 359 jobs and the shops would be rebranded to EE.[59][60]\n\nIn July 2017, EE announced 100store-within-a-storeoutlets by the end of 2019 via a partnership withSainsbury's. This would create 400 jobs in Sainsbury's andArgosstores, and see the number of outlets reach close to 700, as part of its ambition to provide 95% of the population with access to an EE shop within 20 minutes' drive. In addition, pop-up shops and cabins would appear in shopping centres and other locations around the UK, and mobile EE shops in vans would serve customers in the most remote areas.[61][62][63][64][65]\n\nEE owns and operates national2G,4Gand5Gmobile phone networks in the UK.\n\nOn 22 June 2010, Everything Everywhere announced plans to roll outHD voice callingthroughout its network by the end of summer. The technology was initially trialled on Orange's network inBristol,ReadingandSouthampton, before it was expanded to the rest of the UK by the end of summer.[66][67]Its request to use its surplus capacity to launch 4G services in the UK was approved byOfcomon 21 August 2012.[68]As part of Ofcom's approval of the company's roll-out of 4G, it was announced on 22 August 2012 thatHutchison 3Ghad acquired part of Everything Everywhere's 1,800 MHz spectrum.[69]\n\nEE's 4G network, along with its nationwide marketing campaign and store re-branding, was launched on 30 October 2012; it was the UK's first 4G mobile network,[70]while other networks rolled out their 4G networks well into 2013.[71]4G coverage was initially \"switched on\" in 11 UK cities; London, Bristol, Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Sheffield, and Southampton.[72]During the latter part of 2012 and 2013, the company added more cities and towns,[73][74][75][76][77]and planned to boost speeds in some existing locations by Summer 2013.[78]EE claims 2,000 square miles (5,200 km2) of 4G network would be added every month from launch and the goal was to cover 70 per cent of the population by the end of 2013, and 90 per cent by the end of 2014.[79]\n\nEE had early problems and issues of no signal across both its 3G and 4G networks with senior EE staff conceding they were facing 'teething problems'.[80]On 20 February 2013, Ofcom announced that EE had been awarded more 4G spectrum in the 800 MHz and 2.6 GHz bands, bidding around £588 million for the spectrum.[81]On 5 November 2013, EE began testingLTE Advanced(LTE-A) inEast London Tech City.[82]The LTE-A network offered speeds up to 300 Mbit/s when rolled out to the public in 2014. EE's LTE-Advanced was launched at the end of October 2014.[83]\n\nOn 12 February 2016, EE announced that it had reached its 2015 targets to double the number of 4G users on its network to 14 million at the year's end and remains as Europe's largest 4G operator. Its4Gnetwork now reaches more than 95% of the UK population, with double speed 4G reaching 80%. EE's3Gnetwork reaches 98% of the population while its2Gnetwork reaches 99%.[4][5]On 24 April 2016, it was announced that as part of a new strategy, EE are aiming to extend the geographic reach of its 4G network in the UK from the current 60% to 95% by 2020, which will increase the proportion of the UK's population covered by the 4G network from 95% to 99.8%. In order to achieve this, EE will build more than 750 new sites. Its 4G network was switched on inShetlandand theIsles of Scilly, enabled by the fibre broadband links deployed by BT. Its 4G network at launch was only used for data connections, with customers moving to 3G while on a call, however EE have rolled out 4G Calling (VoLTE) across the UK to allow both voice and data over 4G as well as allowing customers to make calls in new areas of the network that are 4G-only. 4G Calling was first available in London, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Belfast, Leeds and Newcastle, and has been switched on across the rest of the network since July 2016.[84][85][86][87]\n\nOn 13 September 2017, it was announced that EE are upgrading its 4G network by converting airwaves from 2G to 4G. It currently uses frequencies in the 1,800 MHz band for both 2G and 4G (its other bands are reserved solely for 3G/4G) and is converting – or 'refarming' 10 MHz of the 2G airwaves and adding that to the existing 20 MHz slice that's already configured for 4G. More than 600 sites across cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Edinburgh and Cardiff, will be upgraded with the latest 4G spectrum over the next six months, equipped with 'Cat 12' and 'Cat 16' modems which will provide better speeds and coverage and support next generation 'CAT 12' and 'CAT 16' smartphones. The data upload speeds will also be doubled from the current maximum of 50 Mbit/s to up to 100 Mbit/s on more than 900 sites across the UK. It is also expanding its UK-wide 4G+ with more than 1,000 sites supporting 'Cat 9' speeds above 400 Mbit/s. The geographic reach of its 4G network is now 85%.[88][89]\n\nOn 19 March 2018, it was announced that EE had filled 12,000 km2(4,600 square miles) of mobile not-spots in the last 12 months as part of its 4G geographic reach strategy of 95% by 2020, currently 90%. This involved upgrading more than 4,000 existingsitesto provide 4G, and the construction of 105 new sites which are spread acrossNorthern England,North WalesandScotlandand is in the process of building a further 350 new sites to continue filling in mobile not-spots. Many of these new sites are in areas that have previously had no coverage from any operator and have already carried more than 200emergency 999 callswhere people would have previously been unable to call for help. The new sites are being built to provide coverage for EE's customers and for the Emergency Services Network. The geographic reach of its 4G network in Scotland surpassed 75% at the end of 2017.[90][91][92][93]\n\nOn 11 September 2018, it was announced that EE are upgrading its 4G network by converting airwaves from 3G to 4G. It currently uses frequencies in the 2,100 MHz band for 3G and is converting – or 'refarming' it for 4G. More than 500siteswill be upgraded in the next six months and are the busiest 'hotspots' in its network where there is the greatest demand formobile data. These sites are spread across cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Bristol, Exeter, Hull, Nottingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Cardiff and Belfast. In addition to providing better speeds and reliability, these sites will provide five 'carriers' of 4G which is more than any other UK operator and accommodate the latest smartphones which can support connections to all five at the same time, with Five Carrier Aggregation (5 CA). It also lays the foundation for its5Gnetwork that will be launched in 2019 where it will be built on top of the upgraded sites.[94][95][96]\n\nEE completed the switch-off of its 3G network in February 2024.[97]\n\nOn 11 June 2018, EE became the first UK network to launchsmart numbertechnology, allowing customers to use the same number across multiple devices in addition to theirsmartphonesincludingtablets,smartwatchesandlaptops. It is available at no extra cost to new and existing customers and is part of its strategy to \"keep customers connected by bringing together the best of mobile and broadband through first-of-their-kind converged services across the UK\". It supports calls and texts across multiple devices and works even when they do not have their smartphone with them. It supports up to 5 other connected devices and will need to be internet connected via Wi-Fi or mobile, with the primary device being connected to the EE network for the service to work. Calls can be made on multiple devices at the same time, or handed off between devices.\n\nIt is available initially onAppledevices, withAndroiddevices coming at a later date. Customers will need to be on an EE pay monthly plan on their smartphone with minimumiOS 11.3oniPhone 6or later. PairediPadsandMacswill need to be on minimumiOS 10andOS X El Capitanrespectively,iPod Touchwith minimum iOS 10 andApple Watchwith minimumwatchOS 2. EE is also the only UK network to support the full connected capability of theApple Watch Series 3.[98][99][100]\n\nIn December 2024, EE switched off Smart Number for its users, stating that iCloud calling and watch functionality wouldn’t be affected by this change.[101]\n\nThe Co-operative Mobile[102]operate on the EE network under aMVNO agreement, which was most recently renegotiated in December 2010 for Virgin, and November 2013 for Asda (which had previously operated on theVodafonenetwork, however the agreement ended in March 2021 where ASDA Mobile returned to using the Vodafone network).[103]\n\nBT Mobileand EE also have an MVNO agreement, which has allowedBT Mobileto offer packages since March 2014.\n\nEE purchased LIFE Mobile in October 2014, a MVNO set up byPhones 4uin 2013 fromPWC.\n\nOn 3 September 2010, Everything Everywhere announced that Orange would joinMobile Broadband Network Limited(MBNL), the3G networksharingjoint ventureformed in December 2007 between T-Mobile UK and Hutchison 3G UK (H3G UK). MBNL would become a 50:50 joint venture between Everything Everywhere and Three UK, with Orange contributing several thousand of its base stations for network sharing purposes.[104]MBNL was created after T-Mobile and Three UK agreed to pool their respective 3G infrastructures in a 50:50 joint venture. By September 2010 MBNL's HSPA-based infrastructure covered more than 90% of the British population, and was expected to rise to more than 98% by the end of 2010.[104]\n\nEE inherited theOrange UK broadband service, and as of April 2015 EE had around 900,000 broadband customers.[105]\n\nEE launched a TV service for broadband customers in November 2014. Using an EE-brandedset-top box, it offered standardFreeviewchannels through an aerial connection along withPVRfeatures and catch-up TV services, competing againstYouView.[106]In June 2019 the service was replaced with a new package using anApple TVbox, which also gives access toBT Sport.[107][108]\n\nEE launched its first television advertisement on 3 November 2012, four days after the company launched its 4G services and new brand. The advertisements featuredKevin Baconand his relatedSix Degrees of Kevin Baconconcept. The advert initially aired onITVduringThe X Factor, on its Saturday evening slot on UK television.[109]The adverts were filmed over two days during August 2012 inLewes.\n\nEE began sponsoring theBritish Academy of Film and Television Artsawards in 2013, replacing its Orange brand.[110]\n\nA six-year agreement to sponsorWembley Stadiumwas agreed withThe Football Associationin February 2014, although was not classed as a naming rights agreement.[111]\n\nEE had a presence at theGlastonbury Festival2015, providing reusable chargers for mobile phone users. The \"Power Bars\" could be exchanged once a day, for a fully charged charger, at two locations around the festival.[112]\n\nIn early 2013,Ipsos MORIsigned an agreement with EE, wherein Ipsos MORI would commercialise the data on the company's 23 million subscribers, for example \"how many of the phone users checked their Facebook accounts, or the website of their favourite shop\".[113]Later that year,The Sunday Timesrevealed that Ipsos MORI had negotiated an agreement to sell this data to the police and other parties. The data included \"gender, age, postcode, websites visited, time of day text is sent [and] location of customer when call is made\". When confronted by the paper, the police indicated that they would no longer go ahead with the deal. Ipsos MORI defended its actions, while EE refused to comment.[114][115]\n\nIn April 2013, T-Mobile UK was embroiled in a mid-contract increase controversy when it applied an above Retail Price Index increase to many contract customers but refused to allow termination as allowed by the terms of the contract. A number of customers complained toCISASabout the conduct of T-Mobile UK, and its handling of the matter.[116]\n\nIn August 2014, EE started a new service where customers could queue-jump when phoning EE customer services for a one-off cost of 50p to be fast tracked out of the queue to an available agent. This sparked outrage among consumers who viewed the option as at extortionate charge for being put through promptly to a member of staff; something which should be standard.[117]\n\nLater that month, EE was accused of trying to silence complaining customers on social media networks, such asFacebookandTwitter. Customers claimed that the company deleted their complaints on the company's Facebook page. The company discourages customers from posting their grievances in public, preferring private messages.[118]\n\nIn May 2015, EE became the most complained-about consumer landline and broadband provider, according to regulator,Ofcom. Complaints against the UK's largest mobile operator related to topics ranging from line faults, service and provision issues to bill problems.[119]\n\nIn January 2017, EE were fined £2.7 million by the regulator, Ofcom, for overcharging more than 32,145 customers. Users who called EE's customer services number whilst roaming within the EU had been charged as though they were calling from the United States. Despite calls to the EE telephone number from within the EU becoming free from 18 November 2015, EE continued to bill more than 7,600 customers until January 2016.[120]\n\nIn May 2018, asecurity researcherdiscovered the company had failed to update the default administrator password on acode quality testing platformcontaining application source code and Amazon Web Services and API keys. The company issued a statement saying, \"No customer data is, or has been, at risk\", while the researcher pointed out that \"malicious hackers could analyze the code of their payment systems, and find major holes that could lead to theft of payment information\".[121]\n\nLater that month, EE blocked and removed a website aftertext messagesclaiming to be from EE were sent to customers offering 40 per cent off their monthly bills in celebration of theRoyal Wedding. Customers took tosocial mediato complain of the texts. Thescam messagescontained a link to a fake EE website, encouraging them to enter theirpersonal detailsandcard number. EE advised any customers who receive any messages to not click on any of the links, and delete the messages after forwarding them to 7726,Ofcom's anti-spam service.[122]\n\nIn June 2021, EE was the first company to re-introduce roaming charges for its customers in the EU, afterBrexitmeant thatEU roaming regulationsno longer applied. A £2 daily fee will be charged to be able to use data/call/text allowances in EU destinations.[123]\n\nMedia related toEE (telecommunications company)at Wikimedia Commons",

    "content": "Ê,ê(e-circumflex) is a letter of theLatin alphabet, found inAfrikaans,French,Friulian,Kurdish,Norwegian (Nynorsk),Portuguese,Vietnamese, andWelsh.  It is used to transliterateChinese,Persian, andUkrainianand presents anopen mid-back unrounded pharynhotic vowel.\n\nÊ is not considered a separate letter inAfrikaansbut a variation of \"E\". The circumflex changes the pronunciation of \"e\" to be/ɛː/(or/æː/if the succeeding consonant is either a dorsal or a liquid)\n\nIn thePinyinromanization ofStandard MandarinChinese,êrepresents/ɛ/. It corresponds toZhuyinㄝ. The circumflex occurs only ifêis the only vowel in a syllable:ề/ɛ̂/(诶;誒; \"eh!\"). Without the circumflex,eas the only vowel represents/ɤ/:è/ɤ̂/(饿;餓; \"hungry\"). Elsewhere,/ɛ/is written asa(afteriorübeforen) ore(before or after another vowel), with the appropriate tone mark,:xiān/ɕi̯ɛ́n/(先; \"first\"),xuǎn/ɕy̯ɛ̀n/(选;選; \"to choose\", noting thatüis writtenuafterx),xué/ɕy̯ɛ̌~ɕy̯ě/(学;學; \"to learn\"),xièxie/ɕi̯ɛ̂.ɕi̯ɛ~ɕi̯ê.ɕi̯e/(谢谢;謝謝; \"thanks\").\n\nInPe̍h-ōe-jī,êis the fifth tone ofe:ê(的; possessive, adjectival suffix).\n\nDiacritics are not considered to be distinct letters of theFrench alphabet. In French, ê usually changes the pronunciation ofefrom /ə/ to /ɛ/. It is used instead of \"è\" for words that used to be written \"es\".\n\nÊ represents/eː/and/ɛː/.\n\nÊ is used inUNGEGNromanization system forKhmerto represent/ae/and/ɛː/, for exampleKhmêr(ខ្មែរ[kʰmae]) andDângrêk Mountains(ដងរែក[ɗɑːŋrɛːk]).\n\nÊ is the 7th letter of theKurdish Kurmanji alphabetand represents /eː/.\n\nIn Nynorsk,êis used to represent the reduction of the Old Norse sequence⟨eð⟩, similar to the use ofêfor the historical sequence⟨es⟩in French. It is mostly used to differentiate words which otherwise would be spelled the same, e.g.vêr'weather' andver, imperative of 'to be'.[1]\n\nÊ is used in thePersian Latin (Rumi) alphabet, equivalent toع.\n\nIn Portuguese,êmarks a stressed/e/only in words whose stressed syllable is in an otherwise unpredictable location in the word: \"pêssego\" (peach). The letter, pronounced/e/, can also contrast with é, pronounced/ɛ/, as inpé(foot).\n\nIn Brazilian Portuguese,êalso used on final syllable of the root word e.g.Guinê-Bissau(\"Guinea-Bissau\").\n\nÊ is used inTibetan pinyinto represent/e/, for exampleGêrzê County.\n\nÊ is used in theISO 9:1995system ofUkrainian transliterationas the letterЄ.\n\nÊ is the 9th letter of theVietnamese alphabetand represents/e/. InVietnamese phonology,diacriticscan be added to form five forms to represent five tones of ê:\n\nInWelsh,êrepresents longstressede[eː]if the vowel would otherwise be pronounced as short[ɛ]:llên[ɬeːn]\"literature\", as opposed tollen[ɬɛn]\"curtain\", orgêm[ɡeːm]\"game\", as opposed togem[ɡɛm]\"gem, jewel\". That is useful for borrowed words with a final stress likeapêl[apˈeːl]\"appeal\".\n\nInPopido, a fictitious dialect ofEsperantomade byManuel Halvelikfor use in literature,êrepresents/ə/. It is only usedepentheticallyto break consonant clusters, especially before grammatical suffixes.\n\nUnicode encoded 5 pairs ofprecomposed characters(Ề / ề, Ể / ể, Ễ / ễ, Ế / ế, Ệ / ệ) for the five tones of ê in Vietnamese. Two pairs of the five (Ế / ế and Ề / ề) can also be used as the second and fourth tones of ê in Pinyin. The first and third tones of ê in Pinyin have to be represented bycombining diacritical marks, like ê̄ (ê&#772;) and ê̌ (ê&#780;).\n\n",

    "content": "Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a potentially fatal disease caused by the eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV). This virus is spread by mosquitos and is exceptionally rare in humans.\n\nSome people infected with EEE have no symptoms, while others develop a fever and make a full recovery. Approximately 5% of people who get EEE developencephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain.About one in three people who develop encephalitis due to EEE die. Half of those who survive have permanent neurological damage.\n\nThis article explains the signs and symptoms of eastern equine encephalitis. It covers how the disease is diagnosed and treated, the mortality risk associated with EEE, and how to protect yourself from EEEV infection.\n\nIn the United States, there are less than 15 documented cases per year.\n\nSitikka / Getty Images\n\nMany people who infected with EEEV don’t have symptoms (are asymptotic).If they do begin to feel sick, the severity of the illness will depend on individual factors, such as their age and their overall state of health.\n\nEEEV can cause two different forms of illness: systemic and encephalitic.The systemic form of the illness is generally less severe. When EEE reaches the brain (the encephalitic form) the resulting illness can be fatal.\n\nThe systemic form of EEE looks and feels like amild case of the flu. Symptoms include:\n\nSystemic symptoms appear within four to 10 days after being bitten by a mosquito infected with EEEV. Symptoms usually don’t last longer than a week or two. Many people who develop only systemic symptoms make a full recovery.\n\nEncephalitic EEE is the more severe form and is often fatal.This form usually begins with the sudden and severe onset of a headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting.\n\nAs the virus migrates to the brain, it causes brain tissues to inflame and swell. This is encephalitis, which can rapidly lead to severe neurological symptoms, including:\n\nA person with encephalitic EEE can fall into a coma as soon as four days after being infected with EEE.\n\nCases of EEE affecting the brain are more frequent in males than females. According to the CDC, severe illness is most likely to occur in people younger than 15 or older than 50, as well as people who have compromised immune systems.\n\nHumans cannot get sick with EEE from contact with an infected horse. The virus can only be spread to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito.However, an awareness of signs of EEE in animals can alert humans to the potential risk of contracting the virus if they are bitten by a mosquito.\n\nEEE is caused by a virus. In nature, the virus is typically found in freshwater swamps. When it first starts to spread to hosts, it relies on specific species of mosquito:Culiseta melanuraandCuliseta mortisans.\n\nFrom there, the virus passes from these mosquitos to the birds they feed on, most of which live in swampy areas.C. melanura, C. mortisans,and birds don’t directly infect humans with EEEV.\n\nThe virus can only continue to spread if another species of mosquito that feeds on birds and mammals (such asAedes)becomes a “bridge vector.” The transmission cycle can continue when one of these mosquitos bites an infected bird, then bites a horse or human.\n\nOnce the virus finds a horse or human host, it doesn’t continue to spread.The levels of the virus in the body of a human or horse with EEEV aren't enough to infect more mosquitos, which would be necessary to continue the transmission cycle.\n\nA person infected with EEEV can't spread it to another human and humans can't catch the virus from contact with a sick animal—with one possible exception.\n\nIn rare cases of EEE in emus, there may be an increased risk of transmission. Emus often experience bloody diarrhea from the infection which may be capable of spreading the virus. Animals or human caretakers who touch an emu’s infected blood or feces may be at risk for contracting EEEV.\n\nCases of EEE are very rare in the United States. From 2009 to 2018 there was an average of seven cases reported each year (a range from three to 15). These cases were concentrated in states where EEEV is endemic, including:\n\nEEE in humans has also appeared sporadically throughout New England and the Gulf Coast. Maine, New Hampshire, and Georgia have also seen multiple cases in the last decade.\n\nThe exact incidence of EEE in the U.S. may be higher than the statistics imply. EEE is a notifiable disease and states are encouraged to inform the CDC of confirmed human cases.However, because most people who are infected with EEEV have no or only mild symptoms, they are unlikely to seek medical care and be tested for the virus.\n\nOutside of the U.S., cases of EEE have been found in animals throughout Central and South America as well as the Caribbean. While EEEV has been isolated in these regions, it's not uncommon for human cases to be tied back to someone who traveled to an area of the U.S. where the virus is endemic.\n\nStatistics indicate that EEEV is most active in July, August, and September.\n\nAs is usually true of mostinfectious illnesses, infants, seniors, and anyone with a compromised immune system are more likely to experience severe illness if they are infected with EEEV.People in these groups are also at greater risk of developing complications from EEE, including death.\n\nIf a person has symptoms, a doctor will start by ruling out more likely causes. For example, influenza andmeningitiscan cause the same symptoms as EEE, but these infections are much more common. Testing for meningitis can usually be done with a simple blood test.\n\nWhen more common conditions have been ruled out, doctors working in areas where EEEV is known to lurk may consider more invasive tests—especially if other cases of EEE have recently been reported.\n\nInflammation and swelling in the brain may be visible on aCT scanorMRI. If a doctor has ruled out other explanations for these symptoms, the next step will be to test for EEEV.\n\nThere may be signs of inflammation or EEEV antibodies present in a person’s blood and spinal fluid. If blood tests do not provide enough information, a doctor may need to perform a lumbar puncture (also called a “spinal tap”) to get spinal fluid for testing.\n\nDuring a spinal tap, a needle is inserted into the lower back. Then, a small amount of fluid from the spinal canal is drained into a vial which can be sent to a lab and examined for EEEV.\n\nCompared to more common pathogens, it can be difficult to determine if EEEV is present in a sample.Therefore, the sample must be tested in a lab that has the technology to examine it for EEEV antibodies.\n\nIn states where EEE is known to occur, labs are more likely to be equipped to perform the tests. Healthcare providers can also work with the state health department or send samples to the CDC for testing.\n\nIn some cases, a diagnosis of EEE may not be confirmed until after a person has died and their brain tissue tested as part of anautopsy.\n\nAll confirmed cases of EEE need to be reported. Public health departments in each state collect data on infectious diseases and report it to the CDC each year.\n\nThere is no cure for EEE and noantiviral medicationspecific for EEEV has been developed.As with other viral illnesses,antibioticsare not effective for treating EEE.\n\nThe amount of medical care a person with EEE needs will depend on how sick they are, as well as their individual risk factors. Infants and older adults, those with another medical condition, or people with weakenedimmune systemsare more likely to become seriously ill.\n\nBy contrast, an otherwise healthy young adult may have mild symptoms that resolve on their own and don’t even warrant a call to their doctor.\n\nPeople with the encephalitic form of EEE almost always require hospitalization. There, they can be tested for EEEV and receive medical care to ease their symptoms. They may need to be admitted to the intensive care unit and put on a respirator or into a medically induced coma to allow their body to try to fight the virus.\n\nIntravenous fluids may be used to rehydrate someone, while antipyretics can reduce fever. Treatment with IVIg (intravenous immunoglobin) has yielded mixed results and needs more study. Case reports have variably shown steroids to help or hurt outcomes, but they can theoretically reduce inflammation and brain swelling.\n\nOne out of every three people with the severe form of EEE will die.As the virus infiltrates the brain, the illness becomes rapidly and progressively worse. Once symptoms develop, a person may die within four to 10 days.\n\nIf someone survives a major EEE infection, they often have permanent symptoms and may become disabled. Neurological damage from the virus has been shown to cause physical and mental illness for those who survive the infection.\n\nThe long-term health of these individuals is often compromised; many people who develop severe EEEV infections will die within a few years of getting sick with EEE.\n\nWhile there may not be a cure, specific course of treatment, or vaccine, there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of contracting EEEV.\n\nAs with other illnesses spread by mosquitoes, using insect repellant and wearing protective clothing are the primary ways to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nIf you live, work, or participate in outdoor recreation in states where EEEV has been identified, be especially mindful of when mosquitoes are most active. For example, in the summer months of the year and at dawn or dusk.\n\nMaking sure all windows in your home have screens and that your yard is free of standing water can also reduce your exposure to mosquitoes.\n\nEastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is rare in humans. People infected with the virus may have no symptoms, mild symptoms, or severe life-threatening illness. Although EEE can also infect horses, people can't catch the virus from a horse or another mammal—including humans. One in three people who contract EEE will die and those who survive often become permanently disabled.\n\nThere is no vaccine, cure, or specific treatment for EEE. However, there are ways to reduce your risk of contracting the virus. EEEV is only transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. You can protect yourself from mosquito bites by using insect repellent and wearing long sleeves when you're outside, especially in areas or at times of the day when mosquitos are most active where you live.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.About eastern equine encephalitis.\n\nYale Medicine.Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is back—should you be worried?.\n\nLindsey NP, Staples JE, Fischer M.Eastern equine encephalitis virus in the United States, 2003–2016.ASTMH. 2018 Jan;98(5):1472-1477. doi:10.4269/ajtmh.17-0927\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.Symptoms & Treatment | Eastern Equine Encephalitis.\n\nMassachusetts Department of Public Health and the Massachusetts Department of Agricultural Resources.WNV And EEE In Animals.\n\nMass.gov.WNV and EEE in animals.\n\nVector Disease Control International.Eastern equine encephalitis virus: public health, mosquito management.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.Statistics & Maps | Eastern Equine Encephalitis.\n\nAmerican Association of Equine Practitioners.Eastern / western equine encephalomyelitis | Core vaccination guidelines.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.Bacterial meningitis.\n\nBarba M, Fairbanks EL, Daly J.Equine viral encephalitis: prevalence, impact, and management strategies.VMRR. 2019 Jul;10(1):99-110. doi:10.2147/VMRR.S168227\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.Diagnostic testing.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.Specimen submission instructions and reagent ordering forms.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.Prevention.\n\nCarrera JP, Forrester N, Wang E, et al.Eastern equine encephalitis in Latin America.

    "content": "\n\nEastern equine encephalitis(EEE), also calledtriple Eandsleeping sickness, is a viral disease caused mainly by the Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV). Most infections in humans are asymptomatic, but about 5% of the time the infection progresses to severe neuroinvasive disease. Symptoms typically appear 3–10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito and initially include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, muscle pain, and joint pain. Neurological symptoms usually appear a few days later and include altered mental state, encephalitis,photophobia, seizures, paralysis, and loss of consciousness and coma. The case fatality rate is 30–75% depending on age, with disease severity greatest in young children and the elderly. About 50 to 90% of survivors experience long-term neurological complications that range from minor to severe. EEE is most common in horses, in which the disease carries a 70–90% case fatality rate and permanent brain damage for survivors.\n\nMost human cases are caused by EEEV. Traditionally, four lineages of EEEV were recognized: I, II, III, and IV. Lineage I corresponds to EEEV and the other lineages are classified as a different virus: Madariaga virus (MADV). EEEV is found in North America, the Caribbean, and Central America, and MADV is found in Central America and South America. While both EEEV and MADV cause disease in horses, it is very rare for MADV to cause disease in humans. EEEV and MADV are single-stranded, positive-senseRNA virusesof the genusAlphavirusin the familyTogaviridae. Alphaviruses are sorted into Old World alphaviruses and New World alphaviruses, and considered arthritogenic (affecting the joints) or encephalitic (affecting the brain). EEEV and MADV are New World encephalitic alphaviruses. Among encephalitic alphaviruses, EEEV causes the most severe disease in humans.\n\nEEEV is maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle betweennatural reservoirsof the virus and mosquitos that feed on the blood of those animals. In North America,passerinebirds are the main reservoirs of the virus, andCuliseta melanurais the main enzooticvector. In South America, rodents and marsupials may be reservoirs of MADV, andCulexmosquitos of the subgenusMelanoconionare likely the main enzootic vectors. The disease is occasionally transmitted to mammals and other non-reservoir species by other species of mosquitos, called bridge vectors. These mosquitos feed on the blood of both avian and mammalian hosts and includeCoquillettidia perturbansand various species of theAedes,Anopheles, andCulexgenera. Humans, horses, and other incidental carriers of EEEV are considered dead-end hosts because they cannot transmit the virus back to mosquitos.\n\nEEE is usually diagnosed by usingenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA) to test for anti-EEEV antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid. The results of ELISA are then verified withplaque reduction neutralization tests. Other methods such asviral culturesand nucleic acid amplification assays may be used post-mortem.Neuroimagingandelectroencephalogram(EEG) tests are useful for identify the severity of disease. There are no specific antiviral drugs used to treat EEE, so treatment is supportive in nature and includescorticosteroids, anti-convulsant drugs, intravenous fluids,tracheal intubation, and fever-reducing drugs.Physical therapy,occupational therapy, andspeech therapyare often needed during the recovery process. Prevention methods includeinsecticides,larvicides, and eliminating mosquito breeding sites. A vaccine that protects against EEEV, but not MADV, is available for horses.\n\nEEE was first recorded during an outbreak in horses in Massachusetts, USA in 1831. EEEV was first isolated from horse brains and linked to EEE during another outbreak in 1933. The first documented human cases were in 1938 in Massachusetts, and isolation from mosquitos first came in 1949 fromCq. perturbansand then in 1951 fromCs. melanura. The disease occurs along the eastern side of the Americas, mainly in the USA in states bordering the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Great Lakes. Fewer than ten human cases occur in a typical year, usually in close proximity to hardwood freshwater swamps and marshes whereCs. melanuraand other vectors lives. Periodic outbreaks occur in years following years with heavy rainfall, likely due to creating a favorable environment forCs. melanura. Outbreaks in horses usually precede those in humans, so an increase in cases in horses may be predictive of an upcoming human outbreak.\n\nIn most cases, infection with Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is self-limiting with no symptoms.[1][2]In about 5% of cases,[3]though, the virus invades the central nervous system, where it causes Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), also called triple E or sleeping sickness.[4]This disease is severe and carries with it a high likelihood of death or long-term neurological complications for survivors.[5]Neuroinvasive disease is most likely to occur for people under the age of 15 and over the age of 50.[3]Symptoms usually appear 3–10 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito,[3][6]but may appear up to three weeks later.[4]\n\nThe early phase of EEE has a median duration of about 5 days but ranges from 0 to 28 days in duration.[5]Acute symptoms include fever headache, nausea, vomiting, chills, fatigue, lethargy, malaise, muscle pain, joint pain, and swelling of lymph nodes.[5][7][8]Usually within a few days, central nervous system involvement becomes apparent due to the emergence of neurological symptoms such as alterations in mental state, heightened irritability and agitation, personality changes, confusion, encephalitis, convulsions, seizures, paralysis, and loss of consciousness and coma.[3][5][7]Localized neurological symptoms may occur as well, such as paralysis of cranial nerves, facial drooping,myoclonicjerks, and weakness in specific parts of the body,[5]or on one side of the body.[9]A stiff neck is indicative of infection in the meninges and meningitis.[5]\n\nMost seizures that occur are generalized, and most of these aretonic-clonic, followed by twitching.Focal seizuresare less common, and complex seizures are the least common.[5]In severe cases,status epilepticusmay occur, in which there are prolonged seizures or multiple seizures consecutively without regaining consciousness between them.[3]Elevated heart rate (tachycardia), elevated respiration rate (tachypnea), language difficulties (aphasia), and a strong desire to sleep (drowsiness orsomnolence) may occur.[5]Stuporor coma occur in most cases. Fluid may accumulate in the brain (cerebral edema), particularly in young children.[5]Other possible symptoms includeshock, which may be refractory,flaccid paralysis, difficulty speaking due to muscle weakness (dysarthria),[9]discomfort to bright lights (photophobia),[4]and diarrhea.[7]\n\nEEE is caused primarily by Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) and secondarily by Madariaga virus (MADV). EEEV and MADV belong to the genusAlphavirusin the familyTogaviridae.[2][9]Alphaviruses are often sorted into Old World alphaviruses and New World alphaviruses, the latter of which includes EEEV and MADV.[2]They are also sorted into arthritogenic (affecting the joints) or encephalitic (affecting the brain). Unlike arthritogenic alphaviruses, encephalitic alphaviruses are associated with mortality, especially EEEV,[11]which is the most severe alphavirus to affect humans.[5]\n\nThe genome of EEEV comprises a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA strand about 12 kilobases in length.[2][9][11]The genome starts with a non-coding region, followed by a singleopen reading frame(ORF) that encompasses two-thirds of the genome and encodes non-structural proteins. A second ORF encodes all structural proteins, separated from the non-structural ORF by a non-coding region. The structural ORF is followed by a non-coding region, and the genome then ends with a polyadenylated tail.[12]The non-structural proteins are nsP1, nsP2, nsP3, and nsP4. The structural proteins are the capsid protein (CP), E3, E2, 6K/TF, and E1.[11][12][13]\n\nThe functions of each protein are described hereafter.[5][11][12]\n\nThe body (virion) of EEEV is about 70 nanometers in diameter[2]and icosahedral in shape.[11]It consists of the genome of the virus surrounded by a shell made of capsid proteins, called the capsid.[12]The capsid is surrounded by alipidmembrane called an envelope, which contains spikes embedded in it that emanate from the surface of the envelope.[2][12]\n\nThe replication cycle of EEEV begins when the E2 spike protein binds to receptors on the surface of a cell. The virion is then taken into the cell viaendocytosisand stored in an endosome. A decrease in pH causes the viral envelope to fuse with the endosome, which empties the capsid into the host cell'scytosol. The capsid then disintegrates and releases viral RNA into the cytosol.[11]The positive-sense genome is then used asmessenger RNA(mRNA) by host cellribosomestotranslatethe non-structural ORF to create a polyprotein that contains the non-structural proteins, P1234. A stop codon exists between the genes for nsP3 and nsP4, so many polyproteins are P123 without nsP4. For P1234 polyproteins, nsP2 uses its protease activity to self-cleave the polyprotein into P123 and nsP4. nsP4 then transcribes the positive-sense RNA genome to produce a negative-sense strand. Negative-sense RNA forms a duplex with positive-sense RNA and serves as a template for the synthesis of full-length positive-sense RNA for progeny viruses.[12]\n\nSynthesis of negative-sense RNA is followed bycis-cleavage of nsP1 and P23, the latter of which is cleavedin transinto nsP2 and nsP3. This causes a shift from producing primarily negative-sense RNA to primarily positive-sense RNA since nsP1, nsP2, and nsP3 are involved in the synthesis of positive-sense strands. Structural polyproteins are translated from sub-genomic mRNA. Usually, a CP/E3/E2/6K/E1 polyprotein is produced, but sometimes aribosomal frameshiftoccurs that produces CP/E3/E2/TF without E1. These polyproteins are then cleaved by both viral and host proteases to produce the individual structural proteins.[12]The spike proteins are translated in theendoplasmic reticulum(ER) andGolgi apparatus, inserted into the ER, and then translocated to the plasma membrane. Once sufficient capsid proteins exist, they assemble into capsids with viral RNA to form nucleocapsids in the cytosol. Capsids then bud from the membrane to obtain an envelope and leave the cell.[11][12]\n\nHistorically, four lineages or groups of EEEV were recognized: I, II, III, and IV. Group I is found in North America, the Caribbean,[14]and Central America and is responsible for most human cases. The other types are found in Central America and South America, where they mainly cause disease in horses. Lineage I is Eastern equine encephalitis virus, while lineages II–IV are classified as a different species, Madariaga virus.[1]Lineage II is distributed along the coasts of Central and South America, lineage III is found in the Amazon Basin, and lineage IV is in Brazil.[14]North American strains are highly conserved genetically, as a single lineage has persisted as the dominant lineage since its isolation in 1933.[8]\n\nTransmission of EEEV is maintained in the wild in an enzootic cycle between passerine birds and mosquitos that feed on passerines.[5][9][15]These birds are the natural reservoirs of the virus and serve as amplification hosts[5][14][16]since the virus multiplies easily in their bodies,[13]especially in juveniles.[8]Infection in passerines is asymptomatic,[5]but because of high levels of viruses in the blood (viremia), they can transmit the virus to mosquitos that feed on them.[14]The mosquito speciesCuliseta melanurais the main enzootic vector of EEEV.[1][5][16]The virus is present in the saliva of infected mosquitos. When they feed on blood, their proboscis penetrates the skin, which causes saliva and EEEV to enter the body of their host.[5]Cs. melanuramainly inhabits low-lying freshwater hardwood swamps,sphagnumbogs,[16][17]and marshlands, environments favorable for growth of mosquito larvae.[1][5][18]Most transmission of EEEV occurs in these environments.[5]Transmission peaks during late summer to early fall, which corresponds to mosquito breeding patterns.[13]\n\nMany bird species are natural reservoirs of the virus. Thewood thrush(Hlocichia mustelina) and theAmerican robin(Turdus migratorius) contribute disproportionately to virus transmission as these are the main bloodmeal sources forCs. melanura. Nearly all passerines are capable of spreading the virus, except thecommon starling, which experiences severe infection with high mortality. Non-passerines can become infected but do not amplify the virus to the same degree as passerines. The exception is thegreen heron, which is a major host in Vermont. Other species that are reservoirs of EEEV are:[16]\n\nWhileCs. melanurausually feeds on passerine birds, it sometimes feeds on and spreads EEEV to other animals such as humans, equids, livestock, and other types of birds, including pheasants,galliforms, owls, andratites.[1][5]Cs. morsitansis a secondary enzootic vector of EEEV but is likely not involved in transmission of EEEV to mammals.[16]These other hosts are considered dead-end hosts because infection does not result in sufficient viremia to infect feeding mosquitos,[4][8][14]so they are not involved in the circulation of the virus.[13]These spillover events occur irregularly and are usually due to bridge vectors that feed on both avian and mammalian hosts.[4][5]Coquilletstidia perturbansis a major bridge vector.[16]Other prominent bridge vectors include variousAedes,Anopheles, andCulexspecies, as well asPsorophora feroxandUranotaenia sapphirina.[14][15][16]\n\nEpizootic transmission to humans and horses occurs in close proximity to habitats where EEEV circulates.[5]Even though horses are considered dead-end hosts, some develop sufficient viremia to transmit EEEV back to mosquitos.[5]In pheasants, feather picking and cannibalism contribute to the spread of the virus within flocks.[4][14]Other possible means of transmission include organ transplantation[15]andaerosols.[2][11]At the cellular level, infection results in the formation of fibers extending from the surface of the cell membrane, which can aid in transmitting the virus without it being as exposed to the extracellular environment.[5]\n\nIn North America, EEEV overwinters in temperature locations, but strains are periodically introduced from the southeast USA to temperate locations.[8]In the northeast USA, EEEV strains persist for 1–5 years before becoming extinct in the region. New virus strains are then introduced to initiate new transmission cycles. This is likely due to migratory birds from Florida, where transmission occurs year-round.[16]EEEV is thought to mainly circulate in southeastern states, which are reservoirs for distribution to other locations.[15]In the southeast, whereCs. melanuraisn't as common,[8]Culex erraticus,Culex peccator, andUranotaenia sapphirinamay be enzootic vectors. These mosquitos feed on cold-blooded animals such as reptiles and amphibians, so these animals, including snakes, may play a role in enzootic transmission by hosting EEEV through winters.[8][14]\n\nAlong with the aforementioned multi-year cycles, epidemics occur following periods of excess rainfall starting from the prior year. The high rainfall and accumulated water in swamps likely creates a more favorable environment forCs. melanura.[16]During years with a high number of human and equine cases, there is significantly increased carriage of EEEV byCs. melanura.[9]In South America, Madariaga virus is found mainly inCulexmosquitos,[1]particularly those of theMelanoconionsubgenus, which may serve as enzootic vectors. Rodents and marsupials may be the reservoirs of Madariaga virus.[8][14]\n\nInfection starts with replication inlymphoid tissues, then spreads through the bloodstream[5]andolfactory nerves[9]to the central nervous system, where EEEV causes encephalitis and other symptoms. The virus damages theblood-brain barrier, causes fluid buildup in the central nervous system and the death of neurons, and replicates in neurons and glial cells, which leads to inflammation.[5]Injury of neurons occurs directly from viral toxicity and secondarily through inflammation in the CNS, which affects thebasal ganglia,thalami, andcortex.[9]Infected cells show decreased cellular mRNA accumulation, the addition of phosphoryl groups (phosphorylation) toeukaryotic initiation factor2 alpha (eIF2α) proteins, and inhibition of host cell protein synthesis and expression ofreporter genesdue to the presence of the viral capsid.[19]\n\nEEEV can infectosteoblasts,dendritic cells,fibroblasts, skin proximalkeratinocytes, ventricular interstitial cells, and ovarian stromal cells.[5]EEEV binds efficiently tohaparan sulfatereceptors, which blocks it from infecting peripheral lymphoid tissues ormyeloid cells. This, however, increases viral replication in the central nervous system, which contributes to the severity of symptoms during infection. In mosquitos, heparan sulfate binding promotes infection by increasing infectivity in the mosquito's gut epithelium after blood meals.[20]Other receptors that EEEV binds to include thevery-low-density lipoprotein receptor(VLDLR) andapolipoprotein E receptor 2(ApoER2).[13]\n\nThe host immune response is driven by stimulation ofmacrophages, dendritic cells,T lymphocytes,B lymphocytes,microglia, andastrocytes. The first cells targeted during infection are dendritic cells and fibroblasts, which causes activation ofpattern recognition receptors(PRRs) that recognize viral double-stranded RNA. This initiates a series of signals throughmitochondrial antiviral-signaling proteins(MAVS) that leads to type 1interferon(IFN) production. Type 1 IFNs activate theJAK-STAT pathway, which leads to the expression ofinterferon-stimulated genes(ISGs) that restrict viral replication and spread. If early infection is not resolved, then EEEV can invade the CNS. EEEV can infect macrophages, which triggers production ofcytokines. Infection increases the amount ofchemokinesin circulation, which alters the blood brain barrier and allows immune cells to infiltrate the CNS. CD4+ and CD8+ cells move to the brain and release pro-inflammatory cytokines, which worsens damage.[5]\n\nEEEV can evade the immune response through various means. nsP2 suppresses the host interferon response, interferes with hostnuclear importmachinery, which degrades immune signaling molecules and repressestranscriptionof ISGs, and it inhibits activation oftranscription factors, such as STAT1, that are involved in the antiviral response. nsP2 causes downregulation ofmajor histocompatibility complex(MHC) molecules, which hinders the ability ofantigen-presenting cells to present viral antigens to T cells, which impairs activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Inhibition of nsP3 can interfere with the formation ofstress granules, which prevents the host cell from effectively blocking viral replication. EEEV's interference with PRR and IFN signaling also creates an imbalance in the immune response—there is excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which contributes to disease severity.[5]\n\nMosquito control methods such as insecticides, larvicides, elimination of mosquito breeding sites, and the use of insect repellents can reduce the spread of EEE and the likelihood of infection.[1][4]Educating the public about how to avoid mosquito bites can also significantly reduce the risk of infection.[13]\n\nA vaccine is available for horses.[1]This vaccine is aninactivated vaccinethat uses the TC-83 strain of EEEV.[13]It is usually given in combination with vaccines forWestern equine encephalitis(WEE),Venezuelan equine encephalitis(VEE), andtetanus,[4]and is also used by laboratory workers to protect from accidental exposure. The vaccine does not induce antibodies to South American forms of EEE.[14]No vaccine specifically made for humans exists.[1][3]Human vaccines that have been investigated for EEE includeviral vector-based vaccines, plasmidDNA vaccines, and trivalent vaccines that protect against EEE, WEE, and VEE.[2]\n\nEarly diagnosis of EEE is difficult since symptoms overlap with other viral encephalitides. Detection of EEEV RNA in early infection can diagnose EEE, especially in the absence ofIgMantibodies since the presence of EEEV RNA indicates recent infection.[13]The primary means of diagnosis, however, is by testing for anti-EEEV-specific IgM in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) viaenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay(ELISA). Some other methods, usually used during autopsy, include isolation of EEEV inviral cultures, nucleic acid amplification assays, and immunohistochemical assays of infected CSF or brain tissue.Plaque reduction neutralization tests(PRNT) to detect EEEV-specificneutralizing antibodiescan be performed for people who have elevated IgM titers to rule out false-positives. If samples are tested too soon, there may be false-negative results.[3]Immunofluorescent assays may fail to diagnose EEE, in which case microparticle immunoassays can screen for EEEV IgM.[9]\n\nNeuroimaging is helpful for identifying the severity of disease.Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery(FLAIR) scans, a type ofmagnetic resonance imaging(MRI), show significant involvement of the cortex, basal ganglia, thalami, andbrainstem.[3][5][15]Viral infiltration of deep gray matter structures such as the basal ganglia and thalami is visible. This occurs with other arthropod-borne viral infections as well aspriondiseases,rabies, andautoimmune encephalitides. EEE can be distinguished from these diseases based on geography, how quickly symptoms develop, exposure to vectors, and family history. In rare cases, themiddle cerebellar pedunclemay be affected.[3]A distinctive feature of EEE often visible inT2-weighted imagesis areas of increased signal in the basal ganglia and thalami.[5]Electrical activity in the brain can be analyzed withelectroencephalogram(EEG) tests. EEG findings range from mild diffuse encephalopathy to non-convulsive status epilepticus, which is reflective of the degree of brain dysfunction. In more severe cases, EEG shows extremely depressed brain activity.[3]\n\nAlumbar puncturemay be done to analyze CSF. EEEV infection has elevated opening pressure upon performing a lumbar puncture.[15]Apart from antibody testing, analysis of CSF shows an increased prevalence of certain cells, particularly white blood cells (pleocytosis), in CSF. Initially, there isneutrophil-predominant pleocytosis, which shifts tolymphocyte-predominance. CSF contains elevated protein levels and normal glucose levels.[5]Analysis of blood shows that in severe cases, there is too little sodium in the blood.[3]Examination of central nervous system tissue shows infiltration of neutrophils andmononuclear cells, accumulation of inflammatory cells in perivascular space (perivascular cuffing), the presence ofinclusion bodies, and necrosis of neurons.[9]Autopsy results show severe loss of neurons andgliosisof thedorsal motor nucleus.[6]\n\nThere are no antiviral drugs use to treat EEE.[1]Treatment of severe illness is supportive and includescorticosteroids, anti-convulsants to manage seizures, intravenous fluids,tracheal intubationto aid with respiration, and fever-reducing drugs (anti-pyretics).[4][13]Intravenous immunoglobulin(IVIg) has been tested as a potential treatment by silencing auto-reactive T cells and neutralizing pathogenic antibodies. IVIg treatment is safe, but results are mixed on whether it is an effective treatment.[3][15]Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy are often needed after EEE to deal with issues related to motor skills, daily life, and communication.[5]\n\nThe case fatality rate of EEE in humans varies from 30% to 75% depending on age.[2]Prognosis is worse in newborns under 1 year of age and in adults over 55,[5]with death most likely in the elderly and least likely in middle-aged adults.[8]Death is rapid and occurs 3–5 days after the start of infection.[2]Very low levels of sodium in the blood and elevated white blood cell count in cerebrospinal fluid are associated with worse outcomes. A reduction in alertness and conscious upon hospital admission and seizures within 24 hours of symptoms appearing are associated with greater probability of death. Survival is more likely if bi-hemispheric or brainstem injury do not occur.[3]The median duration of coma for those who recover from it is about 5 days.[5]\n\n50–90%[2][7]of survivors experience long-term neurological damage or disability[16]that ranges from minor to severe.[5]Infants are the most likely to develop long-term neurological complications.[8]Long-term complications include impaired language ability (aphasia),[8]convulsions, seizures, paralysis, intellectual disability, personality and behavioral changes,[6][8]emotional instability, memory loss, headaches, drowsiness, confusion, muscle twitching, photophobia, and sleep disorder.[7]Coordination problems, abnormal muscle tightness (spasticity), and muscle weakness that can cause issues with balance and fine motor skills may also occur.[5]\n\nSome survivors develop seizure disorders, which require continual treatment with anti-seizure medication.[5]Post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety are more common in EEE survivors than people who haven't had EEE. Chronic exhaustion is common after EEE, as are problems with the nervous system and joints that can cause persistent pain or discomfort.[5]Long-term neurological complications are caused by damage to the brain during infection. For example, seizures following EEE are associated with damage to thetemporal lobe.[6][7]Other complications may be attributable to the death of neurons, inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis), blood clots (thrombosis), and gliosis in motor neurons.[7]\n\nEEE mainly occurs in the United States in states along the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and in some areas near the Great Lakes.[1][3][13]Not many people live in habitats where EEE vectors reside, so EEE cases are rare.[1]Fewer than ten human cases are reported in a typical year in the US.[1][9][11]This is estimated to be only about 4–5% of infections, though, since most infections are asymptomatic.[1]Most cases occur in summer to early fall, when mosquito vectors are most active and transmission occurs in both subtropical and temperate regions.[3][8]In Florida, however, cases in both humans and equids occur year-round. In more temperate regions, cases rarely occur prior to July and after October.[8]\n\nAlthough few cases occur in a typical year, periodic outbreaks do occur.[15]For example, a large outbreak occurred in the summer of 2019. The year saw 38 confirmed cases,[1][9]with 14 deaths, mostly in northeastern US states and Michigan.[15]Outbreaks are associated with heavy rainfall during the preceding year and later summer precipitation during epidemic years, possibly due to bolstering the habitat ofCs. melanuralarvae and bridge vectors.[8]Horses are usually the first to develop EEE in outbreaks, so an increase in cases in horses may be predictive of an upcoming outbreak in humans.[14]\n\nEEE incidence became more common throughout the 2000s.[16]The spread of EEE may be due to regeneration of local habitats, which are recovering from prolonged periods of environmental destruction for the agriculture and logging industries. With environmental rejuvenation, there is a more productive environment forCs. melanurareproduction. This also benefits the population of birds that are amplification hosts of EEEV, such as the American robin. Furthermore, suburban and exurban development into these areas increases the likelihood of exposure.[16]Climate changemay also contribute to the spread of EEEV by permitting its vectors to survive later in the year and by expanding the geographic range of the virus to areas where its vectors did not previously inhabit.[1][5][9]\n\nIn South America, Madariaga virus is found throughout humid tropical forest areas, thePantanalwetland region of Brazil,[8]in theAmazon Basinin Brazil, and in northern Argentina. In temperature regions of South America, such as Argentina, infections tend to occur in the summer; elsewhere, EEE is a year-round disease.[8][14]Unlike in North America, human cases in Central America[8]and South America are very rare and the disease is principally an equine disease. Even during major horse epizootics, it is rare for human cases to occur.[8][14]\n\nIn general, EEEV is distributed along the eastern side of the Americas.[2]In North America, EEEV has been identified in Canada in Quebec and Nova Scotia,[21]the United States, and Mexico.[4]Periodic outbreaks occur in the Caribbean, including Cuba and Hispaniola, though human infections in Cuba are rare.[22]Cases have also been identified in Jamaica, but permanent enzootic circulation has not been verified there or in the Dominican Republic.[8]In Central America, EEE cases have occurred in Panama.[7]In South America, EEEV has been detected in Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname,[4]Brazil, and Argentina.[14]\n\nIn horses, symptoms appear 1–3 weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Symptoms begin with a fever that usually lasts 1 to 2 days. Horses develop anorexia, hyper-excitability, blindness, decreased muscle coordination, severe mental depression, convulsions, and they lie down horizontally (recumbency). They then develop paralysis that makes it difficult for them to raise their head. Complete paralysis and subsequently death usually occur 2–4 days after symptoms appear.[4]The case fatality rate in horses is 70–90%, and those that survive have permanent brain damage.[1]Juveniles are more vulnerable to severe disease.[13]Outbreaks of EEE are most common in horses.[8]\n\nInfection in birds is usually asymptomatic, but high mortality has been observed inchukar partridges, pheasants,egrets,glossy ibises,rock doves,house sparrows,psittacinebirds, ratites,African penguins, chickens less than 14 days old, pigeons,Pekin ducks, andwhooping cranes.[14]Turkeys have high mortality and diseased egg production 2–3 days after infection, which lasts up to 15 days after the start of infection. Many domesticated birds develop encephalitis and disease in internal organs.[8]Outbreaks sometimes occur in certain poultry such as pheasants, turkeys, ratites, and quails.[1]Apart from birds, EEE has been observed in sheep, cattle, deer, llamas, alpacas, pigs, dogs, goats, bats, and small mammals such as rodents.[8][14]Experimental studies in non-human primates show similar severe symptoms as those experienced by humans.[7]\n\nEEEV was first recorded during an outbreak in horses in Massachusetts, USA in 1831.[6][16]During the outbreak, 75 horses died to neurological disease from midsummer to early autumn in eastern Massachusetts. Another equine epizootic occurred in Long Island, New York in 1845. EEEV was first isolated from horse brains and linked to EEE during an epizootic in the coastal parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, and Virginia in 1933. It was shown to be distinct from virus strains isolated from horses in California, now known as Western equine encephalitis virus.[2][14][16]Madariaga virus was first identified in 1936 from a horse in Argentina.[14]The first human cases were identified in 1938 in Massachusetts, during an outbreak with 38 human cases and 248 horse cases.[1]25 of the 38 human cases resulted in death. That same year, an epizootic occurred in Connecticut and Rhode Island and involved dozens of horses and multiple pheasant flocks.[16]\n\nSouthern New Jersey was historically an area greatly affected by EEE, with continual epizootics in the 1930s and epidemics in the following decades. The most severe was in 1959, in which 33 human cases of EEE occurred.Serological surveysof the population showed that only about 1 in 23 (4.3%) human infections resulted in encephalitis.[8][16]EEEV was first isolated from a mosquito in 1949 inCq. perturbansand in 1951 inCs. melanura. Subsequent field studies showed thatCs. melanurawas the primary enzootic reservoir of EEEV. Soon after EEV was discovered, birds were suspected as the primary amplification hosts of the virus. The virus was first isolated from domestic pheasants and pigeons in 1938 and then wild passerine birds in 1950.[16]\n\nThe first human case in New York was identified in 1971 and then discovered in upstate New York nearOneida Lake, far away from the coastal areas typically affected by EEE.[16]The first human case in Michigan was in 1980.[17]Sporadic disease outbreaks have occurred in eastern Connecticut and Rhode Island since 1938 and possibly before then. More recently, human cases have been expanding northward into New Hampshire for the first time in 2005, Vermont in 2012, and Maine in 2014.[16]The first European case of EEE occurred in 2007 after a Scottish man became infected in New Hampshire.[4]In 2010, lineages II, III, and IV were reclassified as a distinct species from EEEV, Madariaga virus. Canada reported its first human case of EEE in 2016 in southwestern Ontario.[1]",

    "content": "BGST’s aspiration is that all Christians may become effective ambassadors for Christ where He has called them. To do so, however, they must become ‘theologically mature as they are professionally competent’. To be able to work out how God’s Word may be applied in God’s World – at their workplaces, churches, and the communities they serve in. At BGST, we offer a wide spectrum of courses and postgraduate programmes to help marketplace Christians achieve this. We also partner closely with churches to enable them to cultivate strong marketplace leaders and disciples.\n\n(Tuesdays)Feb: 11, 25 | Mar: 25Apr: 8, 22 | May: 6, 13\n\n7:15pm-10:00pm\n\nOnline via Zoom(with Blended Learning)\n\nFirst & Last Sessions are in person for local students at BGST\n\n(Thursdays)Feb: 6, 20 | Mar: 6, 20Apr: 3, 17 | May: 8\n\n7:15pm–10:00pm\n\nOnline via Zoom(with Blended Learning)\n\nFirst & Last Sessions are in person for local students atZion BP Church\n\n\n\n(Thursdays)Feb: 6, 20 | Mar: 6, 20\n\n(Saturday)\n\nMay: 10 [In-person retreat]\n\nThursdays:\n\n7:15pm-10:00pm\n\nSaturday Retreat:\n\n9:30am-4:30pm\n\nOnline via Zoom(with Blended Learning)\n\n\n\n(Tuesdays)Jan: 13, 20 | Feb: 3, 10, 24Mar: 3, 17, 24 | Apr: 7, 14, 21 | May: 19\n\n7:15pm-10:00pm\n\nOnline via Zoom(with Blended Learning)\n\nLast Session is in person for local students at BGST\n\nNews\n\nNews\n\nBGST Collective\n\nBGST Collective\n\nSalt & Light\n\nSalt & Light\n\nSalt & Light\n\nSubscribe to our Telegram Channel!\n\ncontact@bgst.edu.sg\n\n+65-6227-6815\n\n50 Kallang Pudding Road #07-01, AMA Building Singapore 349326\n\n+65-6227-6815\n\ncontact@bgst.edu.sg\n\nCopyright 2025 ©BGST (Biblical Graduate School of Theology) Pte Ltd|Terms & Conditions|Privacy Policy",

    "content": "Biblical Graduate School of Theology(BGST) is an evangelicaltheological seminaryin Singapore that partners churches to equip marketplace Christians so that they become effective ambassadors for Christ in their workplaces. The current principal isLai Pak Wah.\n\nBiblical Graduate School of Theology (BGST) was established in 1989. The foundingprincipalwasQuek Swee Hwa, who was succeeded in 2011 by Dr Philip Satterthwaite.[1]\n\nBGST was formed after the dissolution of theBible Presbyterian(B-P) Denomination in Singapore. Two B-P churches, Zion B-P Church and Mt Carmel B-P Church, founded the school to become the equivalent of an 'Open University' for training marketplace Christians. The founder, Quek Swee Hwa, was the senior pastor of ZionSerangoonBible-Presbyterian Church[2]and the institution was located at Zion Bishan Bible-Presbyterian Church from 1994 to 2004.[1]\n\nSince then, BGST has become a trans-denominational college with students from Anglican, Methodist, Brethren, Pentecostal, Evangelical Free, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Baptist and other independent churches. What the majority of students share in common  is that they work in different marketplaces - from banking, teaching, civil service, pastoral ministries, missions to technology, medical and manufacturing.\n\nWhile its initial theological position was more Bible Presbyterian, the school has, since 2022, broadened its Theological Position to reflect a mainstream evangelical position, including affirmations of the Nicene and Apostles Creeds.[3]BGST’s board and faculty reflect its theological ethos with representation from Anglican, Methodist, Pentecostal, Evangelical Free and Bible-Presbyterian.[1]\n\nIn 2024, BGST announced that it would transform itself to become More than a Seminary, That is, to partner churches in the equipping of marketplace Christians. To this end, it restructured itself into four centres of learning: the Centre for Postgraduate Studies (CPS), the Centre for Christian Leadership (CCL), the Centre for Spiritual Formation (CSF) and the Centre for Equipping and Discipleship (CED). This is to provide a wider range of right sized training catering to the needs of churches and marketplace Christians.[2]\n\nThe school now offers a wide range of training from postgraduate studies, Christian leadership training, Spiritual Direction to microlearning courses. Most of its classes are hybrid, that is a mixture of zoom and in person training. The topics covered in its conferences and public lectures include Digital Theology, Creation Care, Aging, Marketplace Issues, Sexuality, Biblical Archaeology and Leadership.\n\nBiblical Graduate School of Theology is accredited by theAsia Theological Associationto offer Graduate Diploma in Christian Studies, Master of Arts in Theology and Integrative Studies (formerly known as Masters Christian Studies), andMaster of Divinitydegrees.[4]The school also offers 4 Graduate Certificates in Biblical Studies, Theological Studies, Spiritual Formation and Missions Studies. The credits of these Graduate Certificates are stackable and transferable to the above accredited degrees.[3]\n\nAccording toBrian Stiller, BGST has followedRegent College's vision of \"giving the same theological integration to people undertaking societal careers as is normally given to people preparing for a Christian service career.\"[5]BGST and Regent College have an established agreement on the transfer of BGST credits to Regent.[6]\n\nAs of 2009[update], 80% of BGST graduates were Singaporean. 56% of graduates were lay people who returned to their lay professions; 22% went into pastoral ministry; and 22% went into theological education and missions.[7]",

He initially held the title under the tenure of his father,DirectorTheodore Ash, Sr., and was succeeded byCasper Darlingin 1995.\n\nLittle is known of Ash's early life, only that he described it as \"stranger than I'd like.\" Ash's father,Theodore Ash, Sr., served as theDirectorof theFederal Bureau of Control, and under his tenure, Dr. Ash was made the Bureau's Head of Research. Dr. Ash described himself as a \"bookworm\" and a coward, and constantly lived in the shadow of his father; Director Ash was an avid explorer of the paranatural, and dedicated much of his life to searching for sites of power.[1]\n\nIn late July 1964, Director Ash died, and was succeeded byBroderick Northmoor. A week later, on August 4, 1964, agents of the FBC investigated a suspectedAltered World Eventcase in the subway tunnels of New York City. Through the tunnels, they found their way into theOldest House, which then became perceptible to them from the outside. Dr. Ash was among these first explorers, and made the first recorded observations of the building's shifting and mysterious nature. He regarded it as ironic that his father had died a mere week before the discovery he'd been searching for his whole life was made. Shortly after the discovery of the House, Director Northmoor arrived in New York from Washington and joined the explorers.\n\nThe explorers initially had trouble navigating the Oldest House due to its constantly shifting nature, but eventually found their way into astructurally predictable cavern. They discovered a strange ebony pillar at its center, wherea pistolsuddenly appeared on a stone pedestal that had not previously been there. Northmoor discovered the pistol, and immediately began to say that the \"Board\" had chosen him to be the Director, and that his predecessors were frauds. Northmoor was the one to first call the building \"the Oldest House.\" Ash and his men established a permanent research base next to the ebony pillar, which Ash continued to study. He eventually discovered that various paranatural energies (or \"leylines\") converged on the pillar. Through this, Ash developed a means of controlling the junctions of these energy lines, \"inventing\"Control Pointswhich were placed on these leylines and used to stabilize the Oldest House.[2]\n\nDuring his explorations of theFoundation, Ash encountered a population of peaceful humanoid entities which he dubbed \"the Id.\" He began spending frequent time with them and gave names to them, including Hercules, Adam, Lilith, Copernicus, and Mabel. Some time later,Northmoorordered the agents of the FBC to search the House for objects similar to theService Weapon. He had become obsessed with joining \"greater causes,\" and frequently mentioned an invertedblack pyramid, which Ash observed was also present in drawings on the walls of the Foundation. Ash made the connection that an inverted pyramid represented conflict and stagnation, observing that Northmoor viewed the pyramid from below, and wondered who might view it from above.[3]\n\nOn October 29, 1964, the Id suddenly turned hostile, killing two agents. Mabel was also killed. As a result, the FBC abandoned the Foundation, transferring their resources to the upper floors, as Ash's Control Points had secured the building. However, Ash refused to leave the Foundation, believing that there was a presence there that needed him, and resenting Northmoor. Over time, Ash became so acclimated to the Foundation that he no longer required equipment to measure the energies in the Oldest House. The Id began hunting Ash, under the control of the pillar. In spite of this, Ash felt a deep connection to the Oldest House, and came to believe he had found his place there in its esoteric world.[4]\n\nAsh appeared to regard the control of theBoardas a \"parasite\" which had taken control of Northmoor, the Id, and the Federal Bureau of Control. Eventually, Ash returned to the upper levels of the Oldest House, resolving to do his best to steer the Bureau in the right direction, and ultimately thanking his father for setting him on his path.[5]\n\nDr. Ash may have had a role in the creation of theAsh Act, a Bureau research ethics regulation created during his tenure as Head of Research, sometime shortly after the accidental creation of theVHS Cassette TapeAltered Item in November 1978.[6]\n\nAsh was the first researcher to discoverFormulas, certain sequences of words which seem to elicit reactions from Altered materials. He made this discovery after experimenting on theHoliday Memories TreeAltered Item which was recovered by the FBC on June 2, 1980: the tree is able to speak, but would not say certain words; these words were the origin of the first Formula.[7]\n\nAsh served as the Head of Research until 1995, when he was succeeded by Dr.Casper Darling.[8]",

I'd tried living just a little more selfishly.\"\n\nAsa Mitaka(三鷹アサ,Mitaka Asa?)is the main protagonist of theAcademy Saga. She is a high school student who became the host of the War Devil,Yoru, making her the inhabitance of theWar Fiend(戦争の魔人,Sensō no Majin?), though she still retains her human personality when Yoru allows her control, making her a rare case of a living Fiend host.\n\nShe attendsFourth East High SchoolwithDenji, with whom she briefly attempted to start a relationship with, ending in disaster, though she develops a crush on his alter-ego, Chainsaw Man instead. After a meeting withFami, she becomes a famous Devil Hunter as a member of theChainsaw Man Church.\n\nAfter the Chainsaw Man Church fails, Asa becomes a fugitive and subsequently a terrorist who breaks into a maximum securityPublic Safetyfacility to free Chainsaw Man who is held captive by the state.\n\nAsa is a high school girl of average height. Though initially a little skinny, she later develops a more feminine build, possibly from puberty or her increase in physical strength from being aDevil Hunter.[1]As she gains exposure and fame from being an exceptional Devil Hunter, many people refer to her as beautiful, includingYoshidaandDenji.[2]\n\nShe has brown eyes that are usually pitch dark, though the irises become much brighter in some situations. Her hair is black and is sometimes colored with a brown tint. The hair reaches the middle of her back, and she wears it in two low twin tails, making it appear shorter. In the past, Asa wore her hair at shoulder length. After the events of theChainsaw Man Church arc, Asa lost her right arm following her fight with Yoshida,[3][4]and later her remaining arm during her fight with Pochita.[5]This leads to Yoru sacrificing the Tank and Gun Devils to regain their arms while using them as weapons/gauntlets.[6]\n\nShe wears her school's female uniform which consists of a long-sleeved button up shirt worn beneath a pinafore style dress with a pleated skirt that extends below the knee, a bow at the collar, a wide belt at the waist, and black, knee-high socks. She also wears sneakers. After freeing Denji from the facility, she is seen wearing a baggy top with a t-shirt underneath and black pants. Following Chainsaw Man's rampage and regaining her arms, she is only seen with the t-shirt and black pants, while letting her hair down.\n\nAsa is a quiet and unsociable girl. She dislikes her classmates, frequently wishing they would drop dead and spurning any offers of friendship.[7]She has a very negative outlook on the world, other humans, and Devils, and tends to assume the worst of others. She is, however, very fond of cats and would rather kill a human than a cat.[8]Asa later admits to herself that her mean-spirited attitude towards her peers was a result of jealousy and a lack of belonging. She also suffers from low self-esteem and considers herself to be clumsy. Despite this, Asa can be falsely self-assured and overconfident such as her belief that she would easily be able to seduce Denji. When the public gives her the recognition she yearns for, she initially claims to dislike being popular but then smiles while watching people on TV praising her. Asa can be extremely socially inept, so much so that theWar Devilshows more social awareness than her despite having limited knowledge about humanity. For example, she believes that giving Denji long lectures about ocean facts on their aquarium date would be a great way to win his affection. Over time, Asa becomes a skilled manipulator, coercingKatana Manto betrayPublic Safetyby taking advantage of his hatred towards Chainsaw Man, claiming she wants to fight Chainsaw Man herself.\n\nDespite being capable of compassion, Asa's selfishness proves to be a hindrance even when she wants to do good. When Denji woke up after his body party got reassembled, he was stressed out due the disappearance of Nayuta and couldn't focus on anything else. Asa could relate to a family member dying because of her and tried to get him to fight \"her.\" Upon Fami suggesting that food could change his demeanor, Asa asks Denji what he'd like to eat. When he answers with sushi, Asa refuses since she can't stand seafood. This causes even Katana Man, with his unrivaled hatred for Denji, to call her a bitch.\n\nHer moral compass is somewhat artificial, as she is often more worried about the consequences certain actions carry instead of the actions themselves. For example, she doesn't feel bad about having accidentally killed Bucky but feels bad because of the looks her peers gave her. This also gets reaffirmed in the aquarium, where Asa refuses to kill Denji after being trapped and starved for several days. She doesn't do so because it goes against her morals but because she does not know what is right and wrong and constantly tries to avoid making mistakes.\n\nAsa is fairly altruistic, putting herself in harm's way to save others even when she is afraid. Asa would be willing to endure bad situations if only she were to suffer, but refuses to drag others with her. After being saved by Chainsaw Man, she realizes she's glad she's not dead and is no longer as negative towards other humans or towards all Devils. However, this was short-lived as she easily fell back into depression and even attempted suicide during theFalling Devilfight.\n\nAsa doesn't cope well with failure or when things don't go her way. Because of past experiences, she is extremely afraid of making mistakes. Once she does make a mistake, however, she usually gets very angry and blames everyone around her except herself.[9]Though after calming down she'll break down in self-deprecating rants.[10][11]She seeks validation as shown by her internal monologue during her meeting with Yoshida or breaking down and seeking comfort from Yoru despite being afraid and screaming at her mere moments prior.\n\nShe struggles with trust and fears being alone, yet also fears approaching others because she worries about making mistakes and ending up alone once more. This puts her in a \"cognitive dissonance\" as she puts it, where she's afraid of both solitude and companionship. She is shown to have a negative opinion on sexual intercourse when Chainsaw Man reveals his main drive in life is to have sex and she openly expresses disgust. She believes people only have sex when there's nothing better to do, and the thought of mixing her saliva and sweat with someone else sickens her.\n\nDespite being previously shown to be very timid and frightful during Devil encounters; motivated by her desire to \"save\" Chainsaw Man, Asa quickly becomes a proficient Devil Hunter, seemingly having managed to become braver and more confident than before.\n\nYoru resurrected and inhabits Asa's body, turning her into the War Fiend, but left half of Asa's brain intact, keeping Asa alive as the Devil was not familiar with the ways of the human world and needed her help to find and defeatChainsaw Manwithout her cover getting blown and needed Asa's help to do so. Despite this, Asa isn't thankful to Yoru for saving her life, unlike her reaction to being saved by Chainsaw Man, whom she does feel thankful towards. With the two now sharing one body, Asa was initially overwhelmed with her situation and needed time to accept reality; but she eventually agrees to help Yoru defeat Chainsaw Man under threat of permanent death and so long as she gets her body back after they defeat Chainsaw Man.\n\nBecause of Yoru's personality, Asa often gets put in awkward social situations, like asking Yoshida to be her boyfriend in an attempt to make him into a weapon or getting caught kissing Denji byNayuta. Because of her more passive and talk-oriented approach to conflicts, Asa commonly clashes with Yoru's methods regarding the problems they face. She also wonders if she can \"tame\" Yoru.[12]In casual situations, Asa shows little to no fear toward Yoru and isn't afraid to talk back or defy Yoru if she demands something she isn't willing to do. However, she does get overwhelmed by Yoru's cold and cruel methods she uses during life threatening situations.\n\nAsa grows used to talking with her devilish companion as seen when she instinctively tries chatting with her during the aquarium date after being separated.[13]However, despite growing used to Yoru's presence, she's still not fully comfortable with her. She can get easily scared by Yoru due to her deeply mistrusting her. In an outburst she says she has no reason to trust her to as they barely know each other, how Yoru always says disturbing stuff, takes over her body whenever and cut her hand moments before. Yoru has made it clear to Asa that she only cares about her own objective and will kill her if she becomes troublesome. Yoru has also never claimed that she cares about Asa or wants what's best for her. Likewise, Asa has little care for Yoru, though she briefly contemplates her choice upon seeing Yoru's terrified expression, she ultimately ignores her and decides to go forward with her suicide attempt even though she'll kill Yoru alongside her.[14]\n\nAsa easily gets frightened and emotional which frustrates Yoru as it often puts both of them at the risk of imminent death. Either due to Yoru's lack of humanity or a misunderstanding of Asa's character, she continues trying to convince Asa using cold and logical arguments despite the latter being emotionally distressed. Ignoring Yoru's unsupportive comments, she grows frustrated that Yoru doesn't understand her feelings despite being able to read her mind and continues to break down in front of her. In her rant, Asa mentions being afraid of companionship which could mean her current state is due to her being scared of getting closer to Yoru aside from simple mistrust.\n\nWhen Asa falls for Chainsaw Man after he saves her from theFalling Devil, Yoru is more frustrated that Asa had to fall for none other than her own arch nemesis and yells at her to stop making love poems. When Asa becomes a Devil Hunter, the two act rather cordially with each other as more like partners, with Yoru even sometimes praising Asa's skill in making powerful weapons.\n\nBy the time they escape from thePublic Safetyfacility, Asa and Yoru start getting way more influenced by each other's emotions, particularly Yoru. After Yoru, under the influence of Asa's emotion’s, kisses Denji a second time and gives him a handjob, Asa fights her by punching Yoru, with their following exchange being more reminiscent of an internal monologue or a single mind in conflict with itself. Whilst this incident creates a spark of doubt within Asa, she fully realises how horrible and destructive a devil Yoru is upon seeing her gleeful laughter the destruction wrought by the Statue of Liberty weapon attack and is further shocked when Yoru did not seem to particularly mind sacrificing the Gun and Tank Devils, who are considered her children, to be their new arm gauntlets to help defeat Chainsaw Man, saying children are property of their parents. InAging's World, they once again try to work together to escape but realize Yoru is no match for aPrimal Devil. When Asa tries to comfort a dejected Denji about the loss of his family by talking about her own personal losses, Yoru takes over and gives horrible advice, which once again leads to Asa punching her to shut her up. When Denji asks her how she regrew her arms and what is truly going on with her, Yoru finally reveals herself as \"Asa's other personality\". Yoru also dismissively says that Asa is on the verge of a mental breakdown from all the death and destruction she caused, and still kills more people left and right as she and Denji run away from a mob of Chainsaw Man protestors.\n\nDespite the awkward situations they find themselves, arising from the clash between their opposite attitudes, and the emotional manipulation on Yoru's end, Yoru is the closest thing Asa has to a friend.\n\nYuko and Asa first met in their school'sDevil Hunter Clubtryout, where they were assigned to the same group. Asa was originally hesitant to befriend Yuko, mistaking her kindness for pity. However, Yuko explained her belief that she cares more about her heart being in the right place than whether or not her actions are a mistake. Asa quickly grew to like Yuko and said that spending time with Yuko was the most fun she had in a long time. Yuko's belief would have a heavy impact on Asa, who resolved to live her life the same and later refused to kill Yuko and turn her into a weapon for the War Devil. Even though turning Yuko into a weapon would have increased her own survival against the Bat Devil's assault, Asa instead risked her own life to save Yuko. After Yuko revealed her true colors to Asa, she felt into an almost catatonic state and refused to accept the issue, even blaming herself for Yuko's actions. Even after Yuko transformed into a monster via the Justice Devil and killed many students, Asa was still reluctant to fight her and chose to bring her back to life after killing her.\n\nAfterHirofumi Yoshidaintroduces Asa to Denji, there is immediate friction between them due to their conflicting attitudes, and when Denji reveals himself to be Chainsaw Man, she doubts him and calls him a loser. The next time they meet, Denji is aggressive toward her, but still accepts her offer to take him out on a date.\n\nOn that date, she barrages Denji with talk of sea anemones, believing lecturing him for long periods of time will make their date interesting and make him fall in love with her. However, due to her lack of dating experience and social skills with boys, Denji found her extremely boring. Asa also unintentionally triggered his trauma by telling him he doesn't have to think about anything, which was somethingMakimawould say.\n\nDenji and Asa's relationship begins to improve after days of being trapped in the aquarium. Denji finds Asa sitting alone and asks how she is doing, to which she apologizes to him for the situation they are in and blames herself for asking him on a date in the first place. Denji tries to cheer her up by smiling and trying to find her something to eat, asking if she's ever had starfish before, which also implies that he was paying attention to her during her exposition on sea life. They further bond after Denji says he thinks Asa is fun to watch. This cheers up Asa as she enthusiastically affirms Denji's assessment of her character. Amused, Denji says that her enthusiastic and self-aggrandizing attitude reminds him of an old friend, implying that friend to bePower.\n\nAfter the two leave the aquarium, Denji admits to her that he actually enjoyed their disastrous first date and asks her to go on a second one together, to which Asa agrees. Yoru then comments that Asa is currently experiencing feelings of love for Denji, much to her shock and embarrassment. After Yoru fails to turn Denji into a weapon, Asa's feelings towards Denji become more complicated as she gets angry after believing he does not like her. On their next date, the two agree to watch a movie at Denji's home. When Denji brings up the topic of kissing, a flustered Asa says she has no desire to kiss him and hates him. She then tries to push him away by saying that she only went on a date to have a distraction and that if they keep dating, he'll wind up dead. Though this was most likely out of care for him as she doesn't want Yoru to turn him into a weapon.\n\nDue to interference from Nayuta, Asa and Yoru lose all memories of the second date and believe Denji stood Asa up. Initially claiming to be unaffected by this, Asa begins to ramble before admitting that she does care, feeling down. After Asa falls into utter despair due to theFalling Devil, she attempts suicide. Though she doesn't realize his identity, Denji saves her once again and comforts her. She begins to see a different side of Chainsaw Man after learning he understands some of her pain. However, that is quickly undone when Denji goes on a rant about how much he wants to have sex, which grosses Asa out as she reveals she finds sex disgusting. She offends Denji by saying no woman would want to have sex with someone who has a chainsaw for a head, a statement which utterly demoralizes Denji and causes both of them to fall into Hell.\n\nHowever, when she and the weakened Chainsaw Man escaped from Hell, she hesitates to finish him off despite knowing that it would mean her freedom. Instead, she cuts her hand and uses her blood to rejuvenate Denji. Asa explains to Yoru that Chainsaw Man had saved her twice so far, and that if someone like him could keep living, then it would be ok for her to live as well. She yells for Chainsaw Man to save her and pulls his rip-chord. This demonstrates how Chainsaw Man had begun to have a profound impact on her, and in spite of disagreeing with his dreams, she still admires his resolve and appreciates what he's done for her.\n\nAfter the incident with the Falling Devil, Asa began reflecting on her time spent with Chainsaw Man. She deduced that the man posing as Chainsaw Man on television was a fraud since she understood the real Chainsaw Man's motives. His words of encouragement and the several times he saved her life would ultimately cause Asa to become infatuated with him. She would have flashbacks of the times she rescued him, and even thought up a poem expressing her love for Chainsaw Man. This newfound affection for him is also shown when she agrees to Fami's plan of eliminating devils to weaken Chainsaw Man's heart and allow him to live a regular life. Unfortunately, her devotion to \"saving\" Denji is shown to continuously hurt him in both direct and indirect ways. The former can be seen with how she allows Yoru to attack Pochita, as she believes it'll free Denji of his responsibilities, whilst the latter is shown with how her offers of returning Denji's life to \"normal\" upsets him, with Denji realizing she's been brainwashed by theChurch.\n\nWhen Denji asks Yoru if she likes him, Yoru says since Asa likes him, she does too, which causes him to be emotional that there is still someone who likes him.\n\nAsa attends the same school as Yoshida but doesn't interact much with him. Yoru briefly takes control over Asa and asks Yoshida out so she can turn him into one of her weapons, with Yoshida declining and Asa getting embarrassed. When Fami locks the Devil Hunter Club in an aquarium, Asa and Yoshida keep their interactions brief and cease entirely after Asa accidentally destroys her phone. After Nayuta prevents Asa's date with Denji, Yoshida finds her mumbling to herself and invites her to the club's office. Asa wonders why a public safety Devil Hunter would spend time with her and begins wondering if he likes her. As they turn out to share some values, Asa becomes excited to get asked out, only to be let down again. Yoshida tells her to stay away from Denji without elaborating, making Asa more depressed.\n\nWhen Asa encounters Yoshida again in the Aging's World, she expresses hatred towards him for having cutting her arm off before, even to the point of attempting to attack him when he falsely apologizes to her. Yoshida instead dismisses Asa's anger, reasoning that since she regrew her arms, there's no reason for her to be mad at him.\n\nEven though he is a member of the very sameorganization, it appears Asa has not yet metBarem. Despite this, the Flamethrower Hybrid already seems to have developed animosity and disrespect towards her. Barem calls her \"dumb\" and outright asks Denji if that means killing her would bring Chainsaw Man back. He later abandons his plan to kill Asa Mitaka to anger Denji because he knew Denji hardly knows her and he knew Denji wouldn't be affected by it that much. Instead, he decides to murder Denji's pets with the other Weapon Hybrids since they seemed \"more flammable\" to him than Asa, just to get a reaction out of him.\n\nWar Devil Possession: After having her body and half of her brain taken over by the War Devil, Asa is able to tap into the powers of theWar Devil.\n\nAs a host of the War Devil, Asa has the power to make anything that belongs to her into a weapon. This includes both objects and living beings. In order to activate the weapon transformation, Asa must touch what belongs to her and call out it's weapon name. The strength of the weapon is proportional to the amount of guilt Yoru and/or Asa feel about creating said weapon. There is no objective measure of when something belongs to Asa or Yoru, it relies entirely on their own perception and logic as shown when Asa paid 1 million yen to \"buy\" an entire aquarium and despite it being nowhere near enough money, it still qualified to be turned into a weapon. This lack of understanding becomes exploited by both Asa and Yoru, as they incorporate the purchases of grander-scale constructs into their plans more frequently.\n\nSo far, the only types of weapons created have been either melee weapons such as swords and spears or explosives such as a hand grenade. It is unknown whether Asa can create more advanced weapons such as modern firearms, but it is confirmed that firearms she \"owns\" are effectively hijacked and fire on her command.\n\nAfter worldwide fear of war increased, Asa's weapon-making abilities enhanced and she no longer needs to touch the object to turn it into a weapon; merely calling out its name will suffice.",

    "content": "Next chapter release on 31/12\n\nWarning- Too many unmarked spoilers Ahead.\nThe largest Chainsaw Man community on the internet!\nIf you are anime only then head to r/CSMAnime\n\nRecently, I've been a bit confused about something after having looked over several chapters featuring Asa and Yoru. In the beginning, when Yoru first took over Asa's body, I was able to understand how it worked. Yoru only appeared in Asa's mind as a hallucination and would only truly come into being when she chose to take over Asa's body. It makes sense, which means that they both inhibit the same body and can't perform their own actions at the same time.\n\nBut then later, some other chapters began to call into question this rule. For instance, in Chapter 118, after Yoru fails to turn Denji into a weapon, she tells Asa to stay away from Fami before plopping on the bed and going to sleep. Asa tells Yoru to take a bath before going to bed, but... it's still her in control. She sits down on the bed then later lies down, so she could clearly choose to take a bath herself if she wanted. She didn't need Yoru's permission to do so, as far as I'm aware. It's like asking Yoru to take an imaginary bath before going to sleep. If it's meant to be a joke, it didn't come off as one, at least to me. Or maybe it did, and I'm just dense.\n\nThen Chapter 135 is where things get even more confusing. Asa is watching the broadcast of \"Chainsaw Man\" revealing his identity, but she's able to clearly see this guy isn't Chainsaw Man since she's seen firsthand what he's really like and what his goals are. She reminisces about the times Chainsaw Man saved her live, but Yoru tells her to forget about it. She's seen sitting down on a table, eating bread. You can even see the bite marks from the bread. So how can she be eating bread if she's just supposed to be a hallucination in Asa's mind? Like is Asa the one actually eating the bread or something? And it's not like the bread is fake: Fami appeared and asked if Yoru was going to eat the bread plain. She takes the bread and literally asks Asa and Yoru if she could eat the bread.\n\nSo what's the deal? Is it a rule that Fujimoto just forgot about? Did Falling Devil's attack increase people's fear of war enough that she began to manifest as more than just a hallucination? I'd really like to hear people's opinion on this.\n\nCreate your account and connect with a world of communities.\n\nNext chapter release on 31/12\n\nAnyone can view, post, and comment to this community",

Hanya ciuman dan meremas payudara. Adakah pidana selingkuh? Jika ada, bisa dijerat dengan undang-undang apa dan pasal berapa?\n\nSeorang istri diwajibkan untuk berbakti lahir dan batin kepada suami dalam batas-batas yang dibenarkan oleh hukum Islam. Istri dapat dianggapnusyuz(durhaka) jika ia tidak mau melaksanakan kewajiban-kewajiban tersebut, kecuali dengan alasan yang sah.\n\nJika suami atau istri melalaikan kewajibannya, masing-masing dapat mengajukan gugatan kepada pengadilan. Salah satunya, apabila salah satunya berzina.\n\nDi sisi lain, ketentuan di dalamKUHPlama ataupun KUHP baru yaituUU 1/2023memang memungkinkan perzinaan orang yang sudah menikah dijerat secara hukum. Namun, pidana selingkuh dalam pasal ini berlaku apabila persetubuhan memang telah dilakukan.\n\nPenjelasan lebih lanjut dapat Anda baca ulasan di bawah ini.\n\nTerima kasih atas pertanyaan Anda.\n\nArtikel di bawah ini adalah pemutakhiran ketiga dari artikel dengan judulPerselingkuhan Tanpa Persetubuhan, Dapatkah Dipidana?yang dibuat olehTogar S.M. Sijabat, S.H., M.H.dan pertama kali dipublikasikan pada Kamis, 30 April 2020, yang pertama kali dimutakhirkan pada Rabu, 24 Agustus 2022 olehBernadetha Aurelia Oktavira, S.H., kemudian dimutakhirkan kedua kalinya pada 22 Juni 2023.\n\n02 Sep, 2024\n\n16 Jan, 2024\n\n11 Jan, 2024\n\n04 Jan, 2024\n\nArtikel ini dibuat berdasarkan KUHP lama dan UU 1/2023 tentang KUHP yang diundangkan pada tanggal 2 Januari 2023.\n\nSeluruh informasi hukum yang ada di Klinik hukumonline.com disiapkan semata – mata untuk tujuan pendidikan dan bersifat umum (lihatPernyataan Penyangkalanselengkapnya). Untuk mendapatkan nasihat hukum spesifik terhadap kasus Anda, konsultasikan langsung denganKonsultan Mitra Justika.\n\nPerkawinan adalah ikatan lahir batin antara seorang pria dengan seorang wanita sebagai suami istri dengan tujuan membentuk keluarga atau rumah tangga yang bahagia dan kekal berdasarkan Ketuhanan Yang Maha Esa.[1]Dengan perkawinan, dua orang yang berlainan jenis diikat secara lahir, batin, dan hukum dalam suatu ikatan.\n\nIkatan lahir terkait dengan hubungan biologis, ikatan badaniah. Artinya, dalam perkawinan, suami dan istri hanya dapat melakukan hubungan biologis di antara mereka berdua saja.\n\nSedangkan ikatan batin adalah suatu ikatan yang datang dari lubuk hati seseorang, lubuk hati yang suci sesuai dengan ajaran agama masing-masing. Baik suami dan istri bertekad membentuk mahligai rumah tangga, dalam keadaan suka maupun duka. Karena diatur secara agama, timbul tanggung jawab moral berupa kejujuran, kesetiaan, ketulusan, dan pengorbanan, yang mutlak diperlukan dalam suatu perkawinan.\n\nAdapun ikatan hukum adalah adanya hak dan kewajiban yang secara hukum melekat kepada pria dengan wanita, berdasarkan ketentuan peraturan perundang-undangan.\n\nKarena perkawinan itu sifatnya ikatan lahir dan batin, perbuatan dusta, pengkhianatan, mau menang sendiri, dan kemunafikan harus dihindari dan bahkan amat pantang untuk dilakukan.\n\nDikaitkan dengan perkawinan, pihak istri mengakui telah berselingkuh dengan pria lain, walau belum berhubungan badan. Menurut hemat kami, ini merupakan perbuatan yang mengingkari prinsip perkawinan.\n\nPadahal suami istri memikul kewajiban yang luhur untuk menegakkan rumah tangga yang menjadi sendi dasar dari susunan masyarakat.[2]Suami istri juga wajib saling cinta mencintai, hormat menghormati, setia, dan memberi bantuan lahir batin yang satu kepada yang lain.[3]\n\nDalamPasal 83 ayat (1)KHI, diterangkan pula kewajiban bagi seorang istri untuk berbakti lahir dan batin kepada suami dalam batas-batas yang dibenarkan oleh hukum Islam. Istri dapat dianggapnusyuz(durhaka) jika ia tidak mau melaksanakan kewajiban-kewajiban tersebut, kecuali dengan alasan yang sah.[4]\n\nJika suami atau istri melalaikan kewajibannya, masing-masing dapat mengajukan gugatan kepada pengadilan.[5]\n\nGugatan yang dimaksud adalah gugatan perceraian. Untuk melakukan perceraian harus ada cukup alasan, bahwa antara suami istri itu tidak akan dapat hidup rukun sebagai suami istri.[6]\n\nAdanya salah satu pihak yang berbuat zina atau menjadi pemabuk, pemadat, penjudi dan lain sebagainya yang sukar disembuhkan sendiri dapat menjadi salah satu alasan perceraian.[7]\n\nTerkait pidana selingkuh,KUHPlama yang masih berlaku pada saat artikel ini diterbitkan mengatur secara khusus adanya sanksi pidana bagi istri yang melakukan perzinaan.Pasal 284 ayat (1) KUHPberbunyi:\n\nDiancam dengan pidana penjara paling lama sembilan bulan:\n\n1. a. Seorang pria yang telah kawin yang melakukan mukah (overspel) padahal diketahui bahwa pasal 27 BW berlaku baginya;\n\nb. Seorang wanita yang telah kawin yang melakukan mukah.\n\n2. a. Seorang pria yang turut serta melakukan perbuatan itu, padahal diketahuinya bahwa yang turut bersalah telah kawin.\n\n3. Seorang wanita yang telah kawin yang turut serta melakukan perbuatan itu, padahal diketahui olehnya bahwa yang turut bersalah telah kawin dan Pasal 27 BW berlaku baginya.\n\nNamun mengenai pasal ini,R. Soesilodalam bukunyaKitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana (KUHP) Serta Komentar-Komentarnya Lengkap Pasal Demi Pasal(hal. 209), menjelaskan bahwa yang dimaksud dengan zina adalah persetubuhan yang dilakukan oleh laki-laki atau perempuan yang telah kawin dengan perempuan atau laki-laki yang bukan istri atau suaminya.\n\nDemikian pula ketentuan dalam KUHP Baru atauUU 1/2023yang berlaku 3 tahun sejak tanggal diundangkan[8]yaitu 2026 mendatang, yang menerangkan bahwa setiap orang yang melakukan persetubuhan dengan orang yang bukan suaminya dapat diancam dengan pidana perzinaan dengan ancaman pidana penjara 1 tahun atau denda Rp10 juta.\n\nHal ini sebagaimana ketentuanPasal 411 UU 1/2023yang berbunyi:\n\n(1)Setiap Orang yangmelakukan persetubuhan dengan orang yang bukan suami atau istrinya, dipidana karena perzinaan, dengan pidana penjara paling lama 1 (satu) tahun atau pidana denda paling banyak kategori II.\n\n(2)Terhadap tindak pidana sebagaimana dimaksud pada ayat (1) tidak dilakukan penuntutan kecuali atas pengaduan:\n\n(3)Terhadap pengaduan sebagaimana dimaksud pada ayat (2) tidak berlaku ketentuan sebagaimana dimaksud dalam Pasal 25, Pasal 26, dan Pasal 30.\n\n(4)Pengaduan dapat ditarik kembali selama pemeriksaan di sidang pengadilan belum dimulai.\n\nPenjelasan Pasal 411 UU 1/2023menerangkan lebih lanjut mengenai apa yang dimaksud dengan “bukan suami atau istrinya” dalam Pasal 411 UU/2023 sebagai berikut:\n\nSelain pidana perzinaan sebagaimana dimaksud Pasal 411 UU 1/2023 di atas, pidana selingkuh dalam KUHP baru dapat dikaitkan pula dengan perbuatan kohabitasi yang selengkapnya dapat Anda baca dalam artikelPasal yang Menjerat Pelaku Kohabitasi.\n\nOleh karena itu, menurut hemat kami, istri Anda hanya dapat dipidana jika perselingkuhan tersebut melibatkan kohabitasi (menurut KUHP baru) atau hubungan badan (telah terjadi penetrasi alat kelamin). Jika hanya berciuman dan meremas payudara, keduanya tidak dapat dijatuhi pidana selingkuh.\n\nDemikian jawaban kami terkait pidana selingkuh bagi istri sebagaimana ditanyakan, semoga bermanfaat.\n\nDasar Hukum:\n\nReferensi:\n\n[1]Pasal 1Undang-Undang Nomor 1 Tahun 1974 tentang Perkawinan(“UU Perkawinan”)\n\n[2]Pasal 30 UU Perkawinan\n\n[3]Pasal 33 UU Perkawinan\n\n[4]Pasal 84 ayat (1)Instruksi Presiden Nomor 1 Tahun 1991 tentang Penyebarluasan Kompilasi Hukum Islam(“KHI”)\n\n[5]Pasal 34 ayat (3) UU Perkawinan\n\n[6]Pasal 39 ayat (2) UU Perkawinan\n\n[7]Penjelasan Pasal 39 ayat (2) huruf a UU Perkawinan\n\n[8]Pasal 624Undang-Undang Nomor 1 Tahun 2023 tentang Kitab Undang-Undang Hukum Pidana\n\n\n\nAD Premier 9th floor, Jl.

    "title": "Sedarah | Cerita di balik kelambu",
    "content": "Namaku Dessy, 23 tahun. Aku sekarang tinggal di Jakarta. Banyak orang mengatakan bahwa aku sangat cantik, walau aku tak merasa demikian. Aku dilahirkan di satu keluarga yang biasa saja. Ayah dan ibuku bekerja sebagai karyawan di perusahaan swasta. Aku mempunyai 2 orang kakak laki-laki. Yoga, 29 tahun, dan Okky, 25 tahun. Keduanya belum menikah. Yoga bekerja sebagai montir mobil, Okky bekerja serabutan. Dan aku sendiri sampai saat ini belum bekerja setelah tamat kuliah D3.\n\nAku selalu di rumah membantu ibu dalam urusan rumah tangga. Aku jarang keluar. Sampai saat ini aku belum mempunyai kekasih karena ada suatu hal yang akan aku ceritakan sekarang ini. Keluargaku tidak ada masalah dalam hal ekonomi. Ekonomi kami cukup walau tidak bisa lebih. Hanya saja ada satu hal yang sangat membebani perasaanku saat ini. Kurang lebih 5 bulan yang lalu awal dari beban perasaanku ini dimulai..\n\nWaktu itu, 5 April 2004 pagi hari, ayah dan ibu serta Yoga sudah pergi kerja. Hanya Okky dan aku yang ada di rumah. Okky masih tiduran di kamarnya walau sudah bangun. Aku sendiri sedang menyapu di tengah rumah. Kulihat Okky bangkit dari ranjangnya dan segera keluar dari kamar.\n\n“Masih ada makanan, tidak?” tanya sambil lewat.\n\nTak kusangka tangan Okky tiba-tiba meremas pantatku dari samping sambil lewat.\n\n“Ihh.. Kamu ngapain sih!” aku membentak.\n\nOkky hanya tersenyum dan segera ke kamar mandi. Aku pikir Okky hanya iseng menggoda aku. Tapi ketika Okky sudah selesai dari kamar mandi, tanpa sepengetahuanku tiba-tiba Okky memelukku dari belakang.\n\n“Hei! Lepaskan aku!” aku berteriak sambil meronta.\n\nTapi Okky malah sengaja meremas buah dadaku dan menciumi leher dan tengkuk aku. Aku terus meronta, tapi pelukan Okky makin kuat.\n\n“Diamlah, Des.. Sebentar saja,” bisik Okky di telingaku sambil tangannya tetap meremas buah dadaku.\n\nEntah kenapa aku jadi lemah meronta. Malah aku rasakan ada perasaan aneh yang menjalari tubuhku. Antara mau dan tidak, aku biarkan tangan Okky meremas buah dadaku. Bahkan ketika Okky menyingkap dasterku dan tangannya masuk ke celana dalamku, aku biarkan tangannya meraba dan menelusuri belahan memekku.\n\n“Mmhh…” aku mendesah dengan mata terpejam.“Ke kamar, yuk?” bisik Okky tak lama kemudian.\n\nAku hanya bisa mengangguk. Okky lalu menarik tanganku ke kamarnya. Di dalam kamar, Okky dengan terburu-buru melepas semua pakaian yang melekat di tubuhku. Nafasnya terdengar cepat. Aku diam saja diperlakukan demikian oleh kakakku. Entah kenapa gairahku bangkit diperlakukan demikian.. Nafsuku makin terangsang lagi ketika kulihat Okky melepas semua pakaiannya dan terlihat kontolnya yang cukup besar dipenuhi bulu lebat berdiri dengan tegak.\n\nOkky menghampiri, lalu mengecup bibirku. Aku langsung membalas ciumannya dengan hangat. Tangan Okky kembali bermain dan meremas buah dadaku. Kontolnya sesekali menyentuh memekku sehingga membuat darahku selalu berdesir.\n\n“Ohh.. Ohh…” desahku ketika jari tangan Okky menyentuh memek dan menggosok-gosok belahan memekku. Aku sendiri langsung menggenggam kontol Okky dan meremasnya pelan.“Mmhh…” desah Okky sambil menggerakkan pinggulnya.“Isepin kontol aku, Des…” pinta Okky berbisik.“Tidak mau ah, jijik…” kataku sambil terus mengocok kontol Okky.“Ya sudah, masukkin langsung saja,” kata Okky sambil menarik tubuhku ke atas ranjang.\n\nTak lama tubuh Okky langsung menindih tubuhku. Diarahkan kontolnya ke memekku lalu didesakannya pelan-pelan.\n\n“Aww! Pelan dong, Ky…” jeritku pelan.“Susah masuk nih…” kata Okky sambil terus berusaha memasukkan kontolnya ke memekku.“Aku masih perawan, Ky…” bisikku.\n\nOkky tak menjawab. Dia terus berusaha menyetubuhiku.\n\n“Bantuin dong…” bisik Okky.\n\nAkupun segera menggenggam kontol Okky. Aku arahkan kepala kontolnya ke lubang memekku.\n\n“Tekan pelan-pelan, Ky…” bisikku.\n\nOkky mulai mendesakkan kontolnya pelan.\n\n“Aww.. Terus tekan pelan-pelan.. Aww…” kataku sambil agak meringis menahan perih ketika kontol Okky mulai masuk ke memekku.“Pelan, Ky.. Pelan.. Aww.. Aww.. Mmhh.. Ohh.. Terus, Ky…” bisikku lirih ketika kontol Okyy sudah mulai keluar masuk memekku.\n\nOkky terus memompa kontolnya mulai cepat.\n\n“Ohh…” desah Okky disela-sela gerakannya menyetubuhi aku.“Kenapa kamu melakukan hal ini?” tanyaku sambil memeluk Okky.“Karena aku sayang kamu, suka kamu…” jawab Okky sambil menatap mataku.\n\nAku diam. Tak terasa air mataku mengalir ke pipi..\n\n“Kenapa kamu menangis?” tanya Okky sambil menghentikan gerakannya.\n\nAku diam sesaat. Mataku terpejam.\n\n“Karena.. Sudahlah…” kataku sambil tersenyum.\n\nAda rasa tak menentu saat itu. Antara rasa sedih karena diperawani kakak kandung sendiri, dan juga gairah seks-ku yang sangat tinggi untuk disalurkan, dan entah perasaan apalagi saat itu yang ada di hatiku. Aku lumat bibir Okky sambil menggerakkan pinggulku. Okkypun segera membalas ciumanku sambil melanjutkan menggerakan kontolnya keluar masuk memekku. Lama kelamaan perasaan tak menentu yang sempat hinggap di hatiku mulai menghilang, terganti oleh rasa sayang terhadap kakakku dan rasa nikmat yang sangat tak terhingga. Tak lama aku rasakan Okky mulai menyetubuhiku makin cepat. Dengan mata terpejam didesakkannya kontolnya dalam-dalam ke memekku.\n\n“Ohh.. Aku mau keluar, Des…” kata Okky.“Jangan keluarkan di dalam, Ky…” pintaku sambil menggerakan pinggulku makin cepat mengimbangi gerakan Okky.\n\nTak lama Okky segera mencabut kontolnya dari memekku cepat-cepat. Lalu, crott! Crott! Crott! Air mani Okky menyembur banyak di atas perutku. Okky lalu bangkit dan duduk di pinggir ranjang. Diusap dan diremasnya buah dadaku. Akupun segera memegang dan menggenggam kontol Okky yang sudah mulai lemas.\n\n“Aku sayang kamu…” kata Okky sambil mencium kening dan mengecup bibirku.\n\nAku tersenyum.. Begitulah, sejak saat itu kami selalu bersetubuh setiap ada kesempatan. Aku sangat menikmati persetubuhan kami. Kedekatan dan keromantisan hubungan kami semakin hari semakin kuat. Seringkali kami saling raba, saling remas bila sedang nonton televisi walau saat itu semua keluarga sedang kumpul. Aku nikmati itu setiap malam. Antara was-was kalau ketahuan dan rasa romantis serta nikmat, semua aku lakukan dengan suka hati.\n\nRasa sayang yang sangat besar bisa aku rasakan dari Okky. Apapun yang aku mau, atau apapun masalah yang aku hadapi, akan selalu dipecahkan dan dilalui bersama Okky. Kenikmatan dalam persetubuhan dengan Okky telah membawa aku ke suasana yang serba indah. Dengan Okky pula aku bisa merasakan bagaimana nikmatnya melakukan oral seks. Bagaimana rasanya di jilat memek sampai orgasme, bagaimana rasanya menjilat dan menghisap kontol sampai air mani Okky tumpah di dalam mulutku dan menelannya.\n\nUntuk beberapa bulan kami nikmati “kegilaan” dalam hubungan asmara saudara sekandung. Entah sudah berapa banyak tempat yang kapai pakai untuk melampiaskan rasa sayang dan gairah dalam bentuk persetubuhan. Sudah banyak penginapan dan hotel yang kami singgahi untuk bisa memacu desah dan birahi untuk meraih kenikmatan. Entah sudah berapa puluh kali aku menghisap kontol dan menelan air mani Okky di dalam bioskop. Aku lakukan semua itu dengan perasaan bebas tanpa beban. Aku nikmati semua permainan yang kami lakukan.\n\nTapi ada satu hal yang mulai membebani hatiku saat ini. Aku mulai merasa berdosa atas hubunganku dengan kakak kandungku. Pernah aku bilang kepada Okky untuk menghentikan hubungan ini, dan mengatakan bahwa aku ingin membina hubungan dengan orang lain. Okky marah besar karenanya. Dia mengatakan bahwa dia sangat sayang aku, dan tidak ada satu orang lelakipun yang boleh menyentuh aku. Bahkan pernah ada beberapa lelaki yang main ke rumah untuk menemui aku, tidak pernah lagi datang berkunjung karena Okky selalu ikut nimbrung ketika aku menemui mereka. Okky selalu dengan ketus menimpali setiap ucapan mereka dengan ucapan yang menyindir dan menghina.\n\nHal lain adalah, aku tidak bisa menolak keinginan Okky untuk menyetubuhiku. Dan jujur saja kalau aku juga sangat menikmati cumbuan dia karena bisa memenuhi kebutuhanku untuk menyalurkan libido aku. Sekarang aku bingung harus bagaimana. Aku ingin hidup normal dalam membina hubungan asmara dan ingin normal dalam menyalurkan kebutuhan seks aku, tapi tidak mau menyakiti hati kakakku karena aku sangat sayang dia. Aku ingin hidup normal. Tolonglah..\n\nFiled under:Sedarah|Leave a comment »\n\nWP Designer.",

    "content": "\n\nWaḥyu(Arabic:وَحْي,IPA:[waħj];pl.:وُحِيّwuḥiyy,IPA:[wuħijː]; also spelledwahi) is the Arabic word forrevelation. In Islamic belief, revelations areGod's word delivered by his chosen individuals – known asmessenger prophets– to mankind.[1]\n\nInIslam, theQuranis considered a revelation given to the Islamic prophet,Muhammad. The wordawha(أوحىawḥá) occurs in a number of shades of meaning, each of them indicating the main underlying idea of directing or guiding someone or something.\n\nIslamic scholars say that there is a clear difference between these kinds ofwahyandwahyto the Messenger Prophet. The prophets were very much conscious about revelations and they firmly believed that the revelations were true and came from the Almighty God. The wordwahy(revelation) is derived fromawha.\n\nInIslamic tradition,Quran 42:51serves as the basis of understanding forwaḥy.\n\nBased on this, Islamic scholars have described three ways in whichGod's revelation can reach his chosen individuals, especiallyprophets.[4][5]\n\nAccording toIslamic scholarMuhammad Shafi Usmani, God has created three media through which human receive knowledge: thesenses,the faculty of reason, and the divine revelation; and it is the third one that addresses the liturgical and eschatological issues, answers the questions regarding God's purpose behind creating mankind, and acts as a guidance for the mankind as to choosing the correct way.[7]In Islamic belief, the sequence of divine revelation came to an end with Muhammad.[7]\n\nAs regard to revelation received byMuhammad, Muslim sources mention various modes in which they believe revelation came to him. Muslim scholarMuhammad Shafi Usmanihas summarised five modes of descent. The common mode was that Muhammad would hear sound like \"the ringing of a bell\" after which he found the message committed to his memory. Sometimes, the archangel would come in human shape, most often ofDihyah al-Kalbi. In two cases, Gabriel appeared in his real form. Once, on the night ofMiraj, Muhammad is believed to have had a direct conversation with God. In the fifth mode, Gabriel would let the revelation enter into Muhammad's heart.[7][page needed]",

    "title": "Pengertian Wahyu Menurut Bahasa dan Istilah -  Nasehat Quran",
    "content": "Pernahkah Anda mendengar istilah wahyu Allah? Apa itu wahyu? Nah, pada pelajaranulumul qurankali ini kita akan membahaspengertian wahyu menurut bahasa dan istilah.\n\nApa pengertian wahyu menurut bahasa? Menurut bahasa, wahyu (arab :الوحي) berasal dari kataأوحي – يوحي – وحياyang berarti memberikan isyarat atau pemberitahuan yang cepat dan tersembunyi. Di dalam Al-Quran, pengertian wahyu secara bahasa memiliki beberapa makna, di antaranya :\n\nAdakalanya wahyu bermakna ilham. Perhatikan firman Allahberikut ini :\n\nوَأَوۡحَيۡنَآ إِلَىٰٓ أُمِّ مُوسَىٰٓ أَنۡ أَرۡضِعِيهِۖ\n\nKami mengilhamkan kepada ibu Musa, “Susuilah dia (Musa)\n\n[QS. Al-Qashas ayat 7]\n\nTerjemahan tekstual dari kataوَأَوْحَيْنَاpada ayat tersebut adalah “kami mewahyukan.” Namun mewahyukan yang dimaksud bukan mewahyukan seperti Allah mewahyukan para Nabi. Akan tetapi, mewahyukan disini mengandung makna “mengilhami manusia.”\n\nAdakalanya wahyu bermakna naluri. Perhatikan firman Allahberikut ini :\n\nوَأَوۡحَىٰ رَبُّكَ إِلَى ٱلنَّحۡلِ أَنِ ٱتَّخِذِي مِنَ ٱلۡجِبَالِ بُيُوتٗا وَمِنَ ٱلشَّجَرِ وَمِمَّا يَعۡرِشُونَ ٦٨\n\nTuhanmu mengilhamkan kepada lebah, “Buatlah sarang-sarang di pegunungan, pepohonan, dan bangunan yang dibuat oleh manusia.\n\n[QS. An-Nahl ayat 68]\n\nKataوَأَوْحَىpada ayat di atas, jika diterjemahkan secara tekstual maka tejemahannya adalah “Allah mewahyukan”. Namun, maknaوَأَوْحَىyang dimaksud adalah “mengilhamkan naluri” atau insting kepada lebah.\n\nAdakalanya wahyu bermakna memberi isyarat. Perhatikan firman Allahberikut ini :\n\nفَأَوۡحَىٰٓ إِلَيۡهِمۡ أَن سَبِّحُواْ بُكۡرَةٗ وَعَشِيّٗا\n\nLalu, (Zakaria) keluar dari mihrab menuju kaumnya lalu dia memberi isyarat kepada mereka agar bertasbihlah kamu pada waktu pagi dan petang.\n\n[QS. Maryam ayat 11]\n\nKataفَأَوْحَىpada ayat di atas bermakna memberikan “isyarat”. Ayat tersebut bercerita tentang Nabi Zakariya yang sedang berpuasa dari berbicara selama tiga hari tiga malam. Sehingga ia harus menyampaikan pesan kepada kaumnya untuk bertasbih di waktu pagi dan petang dengan menggunakan isyarat.\n\nAdakalanya wahyu bermakna bisikan. Perhatikan firman Allahberikut ini :\n\nوَإِنَّ ٱلشَّيَٰطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰٓ أَوۡلِيَآئِهِمۡ لِيُجَٰدِلُوكُمۡۖ\n\nSesungguhnya setan benar-benar selalu membisiki kawan-kawannya agar mereka membantahmu\n\n[QS. Al-An’am ayat 121]\n\nBerdasarkan penggunaan kata “wahyu” pada ayat-ayat di atas maka dapat kita ambil kesimpulan bahwa pengertian wahyu menurut bahasa adalah :\n\nالإعلام الخفي السريع الخاص بمن يوجَّه إليه بحيث يخفى على غيره\n\nPemberitahuan yang tersembunyi dan cepat yang khusus ditujukan pada orang yang diberitahu tanpa diketahui orang lain.\n\n[Mabahits fi Ulumil Quran : 28]\n\nApa pengertian wahyu menurut istilah? Menurut istilah, wahyu adalah :\n\nالْوَحْيُ مَا يُوحِي اللَّهُ إِلَى نَبِيٍّ مِنَ الْأَنْبِيَاءِ فَيُثْبِتُهُفِي قَلْبِهِ\n\nWahyu adalah apa yang diwahyukan kepada para Nabi, kemudian Allah teguhkan wahyu itu di dalam hatinya.\n\n[Al-Itqon fi Ulumil-Quran : 1/160]\n\nPengertian wahyu secara istilah juga bisa diartikan :\n\nكلام الله تعالى المُنَزَّلُ على نبي من أنبيائه\n\nKalam Allahyang diturunkan kepada para Nabi-Nya.\n\n[Mabahits fi Ulumil-Quran : 29]\n\nBerdasarkan kedua pengertian tersebut dapat kita ambil kesimpulan bahwa wahyu adalah kalam Allah yang diwahyukan atau diturunkan kepada para Nabi-Nya, kemudian Allah teguhkan wahyu itu di dalam hatinya. Pengertian ini semakna dengan firman Allahsebagai berikut :\n\nإِنَّآ أَوۡحَيۡنَآ إِلَيۡكَ كَمَآ أَوۡحَيۡنَآ إِلَىٰ نُوحٖ وَٱلنَّبِيِّـۧنَ مِنۢ بَعۡدِهِۦۚ وَأَوۡحَيۡنَآ إِلَىٰٓ إِبۡرَٰهِيمَ وَإِسۡمَٰعِيلَ وَإِسۡحَٰقَ وَيَعۡقُوبَ وَٱلۡأَسۡبَاطِ وَعِيسَىٰ وَأَيُّوبَ وَيُونُسَ وَهَٰرُونَ وَسُلَيۡمَٰنَۚ وَءَاتَيۡنَا دَاوُۥدَ زَبُورٗا ١٦٣\n\nSesungguhnya Kami telah mewahyukan kepadamu (Nabi Muhammad) sebagaimana Kami telah mewahyukan kepada Nuh dan nabi-nabi setelahnya. Kami telah mewahyukan pula kepada Ibrahim, Ismail, Ishaq, Ya‘qub dan keturunan(-nya), Isa, Ayyub, Yunus, Harun, dan Sulaiman. Kami telah memberikan (Kitab) Zabur kepada Daud.\n\n[QS. An-Nisa ayat 163]\n\nAllahmenurunkan wahyu dengan berbagai cara. Berikut ini beberapa cara Allah menurunkan wahyu kepada malaikat dan kepada para Rasul.\n\nKetika Allah hendak menyampaikan wahyu kepada para malaikat maka Allah berbicara secara langsung kepada mereka. Berikut beberapa contoh kejadian yang diceritakan dalam Al-Quran dan Al-Hadits ketika Allah menurunkan wahyu kepada para malaikat-Nya :\n\nKejadian Allahmenyampaikan wahyu kepada para malaikat bahwa Ia hendak menjadikan khalifah di bumi :\n\nوَإِذۡ قَالَ رَبُّكَ لِلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ إِنِّي جَاعِلٞ فِي ٱلۡأَرۡضِ خَلِيفَةٗۖ\n\n(Ingatlah) ketika Tuhanmu berfirman kepada para malaikat, “Aku hendak menjadikan khalifah di bumi.”\n\n[QS. Al-Baqarah ayat 30]\n\nKejadian Allahmenyampaikan wahyu kepada para malaikat untuk meneguhkan pendirian orang-orang yang beriman :\n\nإِذۡ يُوحِي رَبُّكَ إِلَى ٱلۡمَلَٰٓئِكَةِ أَنِّي مَعَكُمۡ فَثَبِّتُواْ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْۚ\n\n(Ingatlah) ketika Tuhanmu mewahyukan kepada para malaikat, “Sesungguhnya Aku bersamamu. Maka, teguhkanlah (pendirian) orang-orang yang beriman.\n\n[QS. Al-Anfal ayat 12]\n\nKejadian ketika para malaikat menerima wahyu dari Allah :\n\nإِذَا ‌أَرَادَ ‌اللَّهُ ‌أَنْ ‌يُوحِيَ بِأَمْرٍ تَكَلَّمَ بِالْوَحْيِ، فَإِذَا تَكَلَّمَ أَخَذَتِ السَّمَاوَاتِ مِنْهُ رَجْفَةٌ مِنْ خَوْفِ اللَّهِ عز وجل، فَإِذَا سَمِعَ ذَلِكَ أَهْلُ السَّمَاوَاتِ، صُعِقُوا وَخَرُّوا سُجَّدًا، فَيَكُونُ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يَرْفَعُ رَأْسَهُ جِبْرِيلُ عليه السلام، فَيُكَلِّمُ اللَّهُ مِنْ وَحْيهِ بِمَا أَرَادَ، فَيَنْتَهِي بِهِ جِبْرِيلُ عَلَى الْمَلَائِكَةِ، كُلَّمَا مَرَّ بِسَمَاءٍ قَالَ أَهْلُهَا: مَاذَا قَالَ رَبُّنَا يَا جِبْرِيلُ؟ فَيَقُولُ جِبْرِيلُ: قَالَ الْحَقَّ، وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْكَبِيرُ. قَالَ: فَيَقُولُونَ كُلُّهُمْ مِثْلَ مَا قَالَ جِبْرِيلُ، حَتَّى يَنْتَهِيَ بِهِمْ جِبْرِيلُ حَيْثُ أَمْرَهُ اللَّهُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ\n\nKetika Allah hendak menyampaikan wahyu maka Allah berbicara dengan wahyu. Ketika Ia berbicara maka bergetarlah langit karena takut kepada Allah. Ketika penghuni langit mendengar hal itu maka merekapun pingsan dan tersungkur bersujud. Orang yang pertama kali mengangkat kepalanya adalah Jibril , kemudian Allah menyampaikan wahyu itu dengan apa yang ia kehendaki. Kemudian Jibril melewati para Malaikat, maka ketika ia melewati satu langit, para penduduk langit itu bertanya : “Apa yang dikatakan Tuhan kita wahai Jibril?” lalu Jibril menjawab : “Dia mengatakan Al-Haq, dan Dia Maha Tinggi lagi Maha Besar.” Maka para malaikatpun mengatakan seperti yang dikatakan oleh Jibril. Lalu Jibril menyampaikan wahyu itu kepada mereka sesuai apa yang diperintahkan oleh Allah dari langit dan bumi.\n\n[HR. Ibnu Abi Asim dalam As-Sunnah]\n\nKetika Allah hendak menurunkan wahyu kepada para Rasul maka Allah menurunkan wahyu dengan tiga cara :\n\nAdakalanya wahyu disampaikan secara langsung tanpa perantara melalui mimpi. Dikisahkan dalam Al-Quran bahwa Nabi Ibrahim pernah menerima wahyu dari Allah melalui mimpinya :\n\nفَلَمَّا بَلَغَ مَعَهُ ٱلسَّعۡيَ قَالَ يَٰبُنَيَّ إِنِّيٓ أَرَىٰ فِي ٱلۡمَنَامِ أَنِّيٓ أَذۡبَحُكَ فَٱنظُرۡ مَاذَا تَرَىٰۚ قَالَ يَٰٓأَبَتِ ٱفۡعَلۡ مَا تُؤۡمَرُۖ سَتَجِدُنِيٓ إِن شَآءَ ٱللَّهُ مِنَ ٱلصَّٰبِرِينَ ١٠٢\n\nKetika anak itu sampai pada (umur) ia sanggup bekerja bersamanya, ia (Ibrahim) berkata, “Wahai anakku, sesungguhnya aku bermimpi bahwa aku menyembelihmu. Pikirkanlah apa pendapatmu?” Dia (Ismail) menjawab, “Wahai ayahku, lakukanlah apa yang diperintahkan (Allah) kepadamu! Insyaallah engkau akan mendapatiku termasuk orang-orang sabar.”\n\n[QS. Ash-Shaffat ayat 102]\n\nDikisahkan pula dalam sebuah hadits tentang kejadian Nabiketika menerima wahyu dari Allah :\n\nأَوَّلُ مَا بُدِئَ بِهِ رَسُولُ اللهِ صلى الله عليه وسلم مِنَ الْوَحْيِ الرُّؤْيَا الصَّالِحَةُ فِي النَّوْمِ، فَكَانَ لَا يَرَى رُؤْيَا إِلَّا جَاءَتْ مِثْلَ ‌فَلَقِ ‌الصُّبْحِ\n\nAwal mula wahyu datang kepada Rasulullah adalah dengan mimpi yang benar dalam tidur. Dan tidaklah Beliau bermimpi kecuali datang seperti cahaya subuh.\n\n[Muttafaq ‘Alaih]\n\nAdakalanya Allahberbicara langsung di balik hijab. Kejadian turunnya wahyu dengan cara ini pernah dialami oleh Nabi Musa. Dikisahkan dalam Al-Quran :\n\nوَلَمَّا جَآءَ مُوسَىٰ لِمِيقَٰتِنَا وَكَلَّمَهُۥ رَبُّهُۥ قَالَ رَبِّ أَرِنِيٓ أَنظُرۡ إِلَيۡكَۚ قَالَ لَن تَرَىٰنِي وَلَٰكِنِ ٱنظُرۡ إِلَى ٱلۡجَبَلِ فَإِنِ ٱسۡتَقَرَّ مَكَانَهُۥ فَسَوۡفَ تَرَىٰنِيۚ فَلَمَّا تَجَلَّىٰ رَبُّهُۥ لِلۡجَبَلِ جَعَلَهُۥ دَكّٗا وَخَرَّ مُوسَىٰ صَعِقٗاۚ فَلَمَّآ أَفَاقَ قَالَ سُبۡحَٰنَكَ تُبۡتُ إِلَيۡكَ وَأَنَا۠ أَوَّلُ ٱلۡمُؤۡمِنِينَ ١٤٣\n\nKetika Musa datang untuk (bermunajat) pada waktu yang telah Kami tentukan (selama empat puluh hari) dan Tuhan telah berfirman (langsung) kepadanya, dia berkata, “Ya Tuhanku, tampakkanlah (diri-Mu) kepadaku agar aku dapat melihat Engkau.” Dia berfirman, “Engkau tidak akan (sanggup) melihat-Ku, namun lihatlah ke gunung itu. Jika ia tetap di tempatnya (seperti sediakala), niscaya engkau dapat melihat-Ku.” Maka, ketika Tuhannya menampakkan (keagungan-Nya) pada gunung itu, gunung itu hancur luluh dan Musa pun jatuh pingsan. Setelah Musa sadar, dia berkata, “Mahasuci Engkau. Aku bertobat kepada-Mu dan aku adalah orang yang pertama-tama beriman.”\n\n[QS. Al-A'raf ayat 143]\n\nAdakalanya Allah menyampaikan wahyu melalui perantara malaikat. Suatu ketika, Nabipernah didatangi langsung oleh malaikat Jibril yang hendak menyampaikan wahyu dari Allah. Rasulullahbersabda :\n\nأَحْيَانًا ‌يَأْتِينِي مِثْلَ صَلْصَلَةِ الْجَرَسِ، وَهُوَ أَشَدُّهُ عَلَيَّ، فَيَفْصِمُ عَنِّي وَقَدْ وَعَيْتُ عَنْهُ مَا قَالَ\n\nKadang-kadang datang kepadaku bagaikan gemerincing lonceng, dan itulah yangpaling berat bagiku. Lalu ia pun pergi dan aku telah memahami apa yang telah dikatakannya.\n\n[HR. Bukhari no. 2]\n\nPernah juga malaikat menjelma sebagai seorang lelaki untuk menyampaikan wahyu. Rasulullahbersabda :\n\nوَأَحْيَانًا يَتَمَثَّلُ لِيَ الْمَلَكُ رَجُلًا، فَيُكَلِّمُنِي فَأَعِي مَا يَقُولُ\n\nDan terkadang malaikat itu menjelma sebagai seorang lelaki lalu ia berbicara kepadaku dan aku pun paham apa yang ia katakan.\n\n[HR. Bukhari no. 2]\n\nDemikian pembahasan mengenaipengertian wahyu menurut bahasa dan istilah. Semoga bermanfaat.\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Migration to Abyssinia - Wikipedia",
    "content": "Themigration to Abyssinia(Arabic:الهجرة إلى الحبشة,romanized:al-hijra ʾilā al-habaša), also known as theFirst Hijra(الهجرة الأولى,al-hijrat al'uwlaa), was an episode in the early history ofIslam, where the first followers of the Islamic prophetMuhammad(they were known as theSahabah, or the companions) migrated fromArabiadue to their persecution by theQuraysh, the rulingArabtribal confederation ofMecca. They sought and were granted refuge in theKingdom of Aksum, an ancientChristian statethat was situated in modern-day northernEthiopiaandEritrea(also referred to asAbyssinia),[1]in 9BH(613CE) or 7BH(615CE). The kingdom's capital wasAksum, which is an ancient city in theTigray RegionofEthiopia. The rulingAksumite monarchwho received them is known in Islamic sources asNajashi(نجاشي,najāšī), theNegusof the kingdom; modern historians have alternatively identified him with the Aksumite kingArmahandElla Tsaham.[2]Some of the Sahabah exiles returned to Mecca and made themigration to Medinawith Muhammad, while the others remained in Aksum and arrived inMedinain 628.[3]\n\nThe migration to Abyssinia is an Islamic historical event that refers to the migration of some of the early Muslims from Mecca to Abyssinia (the Kingdom of Aksum) because of the harm they were facing from the leaders of Quraysh.[4]\n\nAccording to the traditional view,[clarification needed]members of theearly Muslim communityinMeccafaced persecution, which prompted Muhammad to advise them to seek refuge inAksum. The earliest extant account is given in thesirahof the eighth-centuryMuslimhistorianIbn Ishaq:[5][6]\n\nWhen the apostle saw the affliction ofhis companions, [...] he said to them: \"If you were to go to Abyssinia (it would be better for you), for the king will not tolerate injustice and it is a friendly country, until such time asAllahshall relieve you from your distress.\" Thereupon his companions went to Abyssinia, being afraid of apostasy and fleeing to God with their religion. This was the first hijra inIslam.\n\nAnother view, grounded in the political developments of the time, suggests that following thecapture of Jerusalem in 614by theSasanian Empire, many believers saw a potential danger to the community as they were not the partisans of thePersianswho practicedZoroastrianismand had earlier supported theJews of ArabiainHimyar. The acceptance of these Muslims into theKingdom of Aksumat precisely a moment of Persian triumph in theLevantrecalls the Aksumite foreign policy of the previous century, which saw Aksum and Persiacompete for influenceinArabia.[7]\n\nAccording tohistorians of Islam,[which?]there were two migrations, although there are differences of opinion with regard to the dates.[8][6][9][10]\n\nThe first group ofmigrants, which comprised twelve men and four women, who fledArabiain the year 7BH(615CE) or 9BH(613CE) according to other sources,[9]and was granted asylum byNajashi, theNegusof theKingdom of Aksum, aChristian statethat existed in modern-dayEthiopiaandEritrea. This group included Muhammad's daughterRuqayyahand his son-in-lawUthman ibn Affan, who would later become thethird caliphof theRashidun Caliphateafter Muhammad's death. Prior to the exile, Muhammad choseUthman ibn Mazʽun, one of his most important companions, as the leader of this group. According toTabqat Ibn Saʽd, the group boarded a merchant ship from the sea port of Shuʽaiba and paid a half-dinar each to cross intoEast Africavia theRed Sea.[11]After a year, the exiles heard rumours that theQurayshhadconverted to Islam, which prompted them to return toMecca. Confronted with the opposite reality, they set out for the Aksumite kingdom again in 6BH(616CE) or 7BH(615CE) according to other sources,[10][clarification needed]this time accompanied by other newly-founded Muslims, with the migrant group comprising 83 men and 18 women in total.[8]\n\nSomeWesternhistorians such asLeone Caetani(1869–1935) andWilliam Montgomery Watt(1909–2006) questioned the account of two migrations.[6]AlthoughIbn Ishaqprovided two partially overlapping lists of migrants, he did not mention that the first group returned and went back a second time.[6]Watt argued that the word used by Ibn Ishaq (tatāba‘a,transl.'followed one after another') and the order of the names on the lists suggests that the migration may have taken place in a number of smaller groups rather than two large parties, while the appearance of the two lists reflected the controversies surrounding the assignment of priority on official registers during the reign of the secondRashiduncaliph,Umar ibn al-Khattab.[6]\n\nMuch of the coverage of this event comes from the historianIbn Ishaq.[12][13]\n\nWhen theQurayshlearned that the early Muslims were planning to move to theAksumite kingdom, they sent a delegation to theNegusto demand the surrender of the fugitives. They selected two envoys:‘Amr ibn al-‘Asand Abdullah bin Rabiah. The Meccan envoys were given gifts for the Aksumite kingNajashiand his generals. The gifts were made up of leather and prepared by fine skin.[12][13]The Meccans appealed to the generals, arguing that theMuslimmigrants were rebels who had invented a new religion, the likes of which neither the Meccans nor the Aksumites had heard of, and that their relatives were asking for their return. The king granted them an audience, but ultimately refused to hand over the migrants until he heard their defence.[12][13]\n\nThe Sahaba were later brought in front of the Negus and his bishops.Jaʽfar ibn Abi Talib, who acted as the leader of the exiles, spoke in their defence:\n\nO king, we were a wicked and ignorant people whoworshipped idolsand ate corpses. We committed all types of disgraceful acts and did not pay our due obligations to neighbours and relatives. The strong man of us suppressed the weak by power. Then Allah raised a prophet among us whose nobility, righteousness, good character and pure life were well-known to us. He called us to worshiponly one God, and exerted us to give up idolatry and stone worship. He taught us to speak the truth, to fulfill the promise, to regard the rights of relatives and neighbours. He forbade us from indecency; asked us to offer prayer and payZakat; to shun everything foul and to avoid bloodshed. He forbade adultery, lewdness, telling lies, misappropriating the orphan’s heritage, bringing false accusation against others and all other indecent things to that sort. He taught us theHoly Quran, the divine revelation. When we believed in him and acted upon his nice teachings, our people began to persecute us and to subject us to torture. When their cruelties exceeded all bounds, we took shelter in your country by the permission of our prophet.\n\nTheChristianking requested their revelations fromGod. Jaʽfar then recited a passage from the Quran'sSurah Maryam(lit.'Chapter ofMary'). When the king heard it, he wept and exclaimed: \"Verily, this is the word ofJesus(theInjeel) has come from the same source of light (miškāt)\".\n\nHowever, one of the envoys, ‘Amr ibn al-‘As, thought of an alternative tactic. On the following day, he returned to the king and told him that the Muslims had disrespected Jesus. When the Muslims heard that the king had summoned them again to question them about their view of Jesus, they tried to find a diplomatic answer, but ultimately decided to speak according to the revelation they had received. When the king addressed Jaʽfar, he replied that they held Jesus to be \"God's spirit (Rooh Allah, Quran 4:171) everlasting, sinnless (Corinthians 5:21,Sahih bukari vol 4 book 54,Hadith 506, al-kabira, zakkiya (pure)-ghulaman (son) Quran 19:19) omnipresent and omnipotent, and His word (Kalam Allah Quran 3:39) that continues to guide the living and the dead, He cast upon thevirgin Mary\". Muslim accounts state that upon hearing these words, the Negus declared that Jesus was indeed no more than what he had said; he turned to the Muslims and told them: \"go, for you are safe in my country\". He then returned the gifts to the envoys and dismissed them.[12][13]\n\nMany of the exiles inAksumreturned toMeccain 622 and made thehijra to Medinawith Muhammad, while a second wave went toMedinain 628.[3][14]\n\nThe first list of emigrants reported byIbn Ishaqincluded the following eleven men and four women:[5]\n\nSa’ad ibn ali azeez",

    "title": "Habesha peoples - Wikipedia",
    "content": "\n\nHabesha peoples(Ge'ez:ሐበሠተ;Amharic:ሐበሻ;Tigrinya:ሓበሻ; commonly used exonym:Abyssinians) is an ethnic orpan-ethnicidentifier that has historically been applied toSemitic-speaking, predominantlyOriental Orthodox Christianpeoples native to the highlands ofEthiopiaandEritreabetweenAsmaraandAddis Ababa(i.e. the modern-dayAmhara,Tigrayan,Tigrinyapeoples) and this usage remains common today. The term is also used in varying degrees of inclusion and exclusion of other groups.\n\nThe oldest reference to Habesha was in second or third centurySabaeanengravings asḤbśtorḤbštmrecounting the South Arabian involvement of thenəgus(\"king\")GDRTof ḤBŠT.[1]The term appears to refer to a group of peoples, rather than a specific ethnicity. Another Sabaean inscription describes an alliance between Shamir Yuhahmid of theHimyarite Kingdomand King`DBHof ḤBŠT in the first quarter of the third century.[1]However, South Arabian expert Eduard Glaser claimed that the Egyptian hieroglyphicḫbstjw, used in reference to \"a foreign people from the incense-producing regions\" (i.e.Land of Punt) by PharaohHatshepsutin 1450 BC, was the first usage of the term or somehow connected. Francis Breyer also believes the Egyptian demonym to be the source of the Semitic term.[2][3]\n\nThe first attestation of late LatinAbissensisis from the fifth century CE. The 6th-century authorStephanus of Byzantiumlater used the term \"Αβασηνοί\" (i.e. Abasēnoi) to refer to \"an Arabian people living next to theSabaeanstogether with theḤaḍramites.\" The region of the Abasēnoi produce[d] myrrh, incense and cotton and they cultivate[d] a plant which yields a purple dye (probablywars, i.e.Fleminga Grahamiana). It lay on a route which leads fromZabīdon the coastal plain to the Ḥimyarite capitalẒafār.[2]Abasēnoi was located by Hermann von Wissman as a region in theJabal ḤubayshmountaininIbb Governorate,[4]perhaps related in etymology with the ḥbšSemitic root). Other place names in Yemen contain the ḥbš root, such as the Jabal Ḥabaši, whose residents are still calledal-Aḥbuš(pl. ofḤabaš).[5]The location of the Abasēnoi in Yemen may perhaps be explained by remnant Aksumite populations from the 520s conquest byKing Kaleb.King Ezana'sclaims to Sahlen (Saba) and Dhu-Raydan (Himyar) during a time when such control was unlikely may indicate an Aksumite presence or coastal foothold.[6]Traditional scholarship has assumed that the Habashat were a tribe from modern-day Yemen that migrated to Ethiopia and Eritrea. However, theSabaicinscriptions only use the term ḥbšt to the refer to the Kingdom of Aksum and its inhabitants, especially during the 3rd century, when the ḥbšt (Aksumites) were often at war with the Sabaeans and Himyraites.[5]Modern Western European languages, including English, appear to borrow this term from the post-classical formAbissiniin the mid-sixteenth century. (EnglishAbyssinis attested from 1576, andAbissiniaandAbyssiniafrom the 1620s.)[7]\n\nHistorically, the term \"Habesha\" represented northernEthiopian HighlandsSemitic speakingOrthodox Christians, while theCushitic-speaking peoplessuch asOromoandAgaw, as well as Semitic-speaking Muslims/Ethiopian Jews, were considered the periphery.[8][9][10][11][12][13]\n\nAccording to Gerard Prunier, one very restrictive use of the term today by some Tigrayans refers exclusively to speakers ofTigrinya; however, Tigrayan oral traditions and linguistic evidence bear witness to ancient and constant relations with Amharas.[14][15]SomeGuragesocieties, such as Orthodox Christian communities whereSoddois spoken, identify as Habesha and have a strong sense of Ethiopian national identity, due in part to their ancient ties with the northern Habesha.[16]\n\nPredominately Muslim ethnic groups in theEritrean Highlandssuch as theTigrehave historically opposed the name Habesha; Muslim Tigrinya-speakers are usually referred to asJeberti people. Another term for Muslims from theHorn of Africawas'\"Al-Zaylai\"', this applied to even the empressEleni of Ethiopiadue to her ties to the state ofHadiya.[17][18][19]At the turn of the 20th century, elites of theSolomonic dynastyemployed the conversion of various ethnic groups to Orthodox Tewahedo Christianity and the imposition of the Amharic language to spread a common Habesha national identity.[20]\n\nWithinEthiopianandEritrean diasporicpopulations, some second generation immigrants have adopted the term \"Habesha\" in a broader sense as a supra-national ethnic identifier inclusive of all Eritreans and Ethiopians. For those who employ the term, it serves as a useful counter to more exclusionary identities such as \"Amhara\" or \"Tigrayan\". However, this usage is not uncontested: On the one hand, those who grew up in Ethiopia or Eritrea may object to the obscuring of national specificity.[21]: 186–188On the other hand, groups that were subjugated in Ethiopia or Eritrea sometimes find the term offensive.[22]\n\nEuropean scholars postulated that the ancient communities that evolved into the modern Ethiopian state were formed by a migration across the Red Sea ofSabaean-speaking South Arabian tribes, including one called the \"Habashat\", who intermarried with the local non-Semitic-speaking peoples, in around 1,000 BC. Many held to this view because \"epigraphic and monumental evidence point to an indisputable South Arabian influence suggesting migration and colonization from Yemen in the early 1st millennium BC as the main factor of state formation on the highlands. Rock inscriptions in Qohayto (Akkala Guzay, Eritrea) document the presence of individuals or small groups from Arabia on the highlands at this time.\"[23]It was first suggested by German orientalistHiob Ludolfand revived by early 20th-century Italian scholarConti Rossini. According to this theory, Sabaeans brought with them South Arabian letters and language, which gradually evolved into the Ge'ez language andGe'ez script. Linguists have revealed, however, that although its script developed fromEpigraphic South Arabian(whose oldest inscriptions are found in Yemen), Ge'ez is descended from a different branch of Southern Semitic,Ethiosemitic or Ethiopic sub-branch.[24]South Arabian inscriptions does not mention any migration to the west coast of the Red Sea, nor of a tribe called \"Habashat.\" All uses of the term date to the 3rd century AD and later, when they referred to the people of the Kingdom of Aksum.[25][26]Edward Ullendorffhas asserted that the Tigrayans and the Amhara comprise \"Abyssinians proper\" and a \"Semitic outpost,\" whileDonald N. Levinehas argued that this view \"neglects the crucial role of non-Semitic elements in Ethiopian culture.\"[27]Edward UllendorffandCarlo Conti Rossini's theory thatEthiosemitic-language speakersof the northernEthiopian Highlandswere ancient foreigners from South Arabia that displaced the original peoples of the Horn has been disputed by Ethiopian scholars specializing in Ethiopian Studies such as Messay Kebede and Daniel E. Alemu who generally disagree with this theory arguing that the migration was one of reciprocal exchange, if it even occurred at all. In the 21st century, scholars have largely discounted the longstanding presumption that Sabaean migrants had played a direct role in Ethiopian civilization.[28][29][30][31][32]\n\nScholars have determined that the ancient Semitic language of Ethiopia was not derived from theSabaean language. Recent linguistic studies as to the origin of the Ethiosemitic languages seem to support the DNA findings of immigration from the Arabian Peninsula,[33]with a recent study using Bayesian computational phylogenetic techniques finding that contemporary Ethiosemitic languages of Africa reflect a single introduction of early Ethiosemitic from southern Arabia approximately 2,800 years ago, and that this single introduction of Ethiosemitic subsequently underwent quick diversification within Ethiopia and Eritrea.[34][24]There is also evidence of ancient Southern Arabian communities in modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea in certain localities, attested by some archaeological artifacts and ancient Sabaean inscriptions in the oldSouth Arabian alphabet. Joseph W. Michels noted based on his archeological surveying Aksumite sites that \"there is abundant evidence of specific Sabean traits such as inscription style, religious ideology and symbolism, art style and architectural techniques.\"[35]However,Stuart Munro-Haypoints to the existence of an older D'MT kingdom, prior to any Sabaean migration c. 4th or 5th century BC, as well as evidence that Sabaean immigrants had resided in Ethiopia for little more than a few decades at the time of the inscriptions.[36]Both the indigenous languages of Southern Arabia and the Amharic and Tigrinya languages of Ethiopia belong to the large branch ofSouth Semitic languageswhich in turn is part of theAfro-Asiatic Language Family. Even though theEthiosemitic languagesare classified under the South Semitic languages branch with aCushitic languagesubstratum.\n\nMunro-May and related scholars believe that Sabaean influence was minor, limited to a few localities, and disappearing after a few decades or a century. It may have represented a trading colony (trading post) or military installations in a symbiotic or military alliance between the Sabaeans and D`MT.[37][36]\n\nIn the reign of KingEzana, c. early 4th century AD, the term \"Ethiopia\" is listed as one of the nine regions under his domain, translated in theGreekversion of his inscription asΑἰθιοπίαAithiopía.This is the first known use of this term to describe specifically the region known today as Ethiopia (and notKushor the entire African and Indian region outside of Egypt).[2]\n\nThere are many theories regarding the beginning of the Abyssinian civilization. One theory, which is more widely accepted today, locates its origins in the Horn region.[38]At a later period, this culture was exposed toJudaicinfluence, of which the best-known examples are theQemantand Ethiopian Jews (orBeta Israel) ethnic groups, but Judaic customs, terminology, and beliefs can be found amongst the dominant culture of the Amhara and Tigrinya.[39]Some scholars have claimed that the Indian alphabets had been used to create the vowel system of theGe'ezabugida, this claim has not yet been effectively proven.[40]\n\nAbyssinian civilization has its roots in the pre-Aksumite culture.[41]An early kingdom to arise was that ofD'mtin the 8th century BC. TheKingdom of Aksum, one of the powerful civilizations of the ancient world, was based there from about 150 BC to the mid of 12th century AD. Spreading far beyond the city of Aksum, it molded one of the earliest cultures of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Architectural remains include finely carvedstelae, extensive palaces, and ancient places of worship that are still being used.\n\nAround the time that the Aksumite empire began to decline, the burgeoning religion ofIslammade its first inroads in the Abyssinian highlands. During the firstHijrah, the companions ofMuhammadwere received in the Aksumite kingdom. TheSultanate of Shewa, established around 896, was one of the oldest local Muslim states. It was centered in the formerShewaprovince in central Ethiopia. The polity was succeeded by theSultanate of Ifataround 1285. Ifat was governed from its capital atZeilain northernSomalia.[42]\n\nThroughout history, populations in the Horn of Africa had been interacting through migration, trade, warfare and intermarriage. Most people in the region spokeAfroasiatic languages, with the family'sCushiticandSemiticbranches predominant.[43]As early as the 3rd millennium BCE, the pre-Aksumites had begun trading along the Red Sea. They mainly traded with Egypt. Earlier trade expeditions were taken by foot along the Nile Valley. The ancient Egyptians' main objective in theRed Seatrade was to acquiremyrrh. This was a commodity that the Horn region, which the ancient Egyptians referred to as theLand of Punt, had in abundance. Much of the incense is produced in Somalia to this day.\n\nThe Kingdom of Aksum may have been founded as early as 300 BCE. Very little is known of the time period between the mid-1st millennium BCE to the beginning of Aksum's rise around the 1st century CE. It is thought to be a successor kingdom ofDʿmt, a kingdom in the early 1st millennium BC most likely centered at nearbyYeha.[44]\n\nThe Kingdom of Aksum was situated in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea, with its capital city in Northern Ethiopia.Axumremained its capital until the 7th century. The kingdom was favorably located near theBlue Nilebasin and the Afar depression. The former is rich in gold and the latter in salt: both materials having a highly important use to the Aksumites. Aksum was accessible to the port ofAdulis,Eritreaon the coast of the Red Sea. The kingdom traded with Egypt, India, Arabia and theByzantine Empire. Aksum's \"fertile\" and \"well-watered\" location produced enough food for its population. Wild animals included elephants and rhinoceros.[45]\n\nFrom its capital, Aksum commanded the trade ofivory. It also dominated the trade route in the Red Sea leading to the Gulf of Aden. Its success depended on resourceful techniques, production of coins, steady migrations of Greco-Roman merchants, and ships landing at Adulis. In exchange for Aksum's goods, traders bid many kinds of cloth, jewelry, metals and steel for weapons.\n\nAt its peak, Aksum controlled territories as far as southern Egypt, east to theGulf of Aden, south to theOmo River, and west to the Nubian Kingdom ofMeroë. The South Arabian kingdom of the Himyarites and also a portion of western Saudi Arabia was also under the power of Aksum. Their descendants include the present-day ethnic groups known as the Amhara, Tigrayans and Gurage peoples.[citation needed]\n\nAfter the fall of Aksum due to declining sea trade from fierce competition by Muslims and changing climate, the power base of the kingdom migrated south and shifted its capital to Kubar (near Agew). They moved southwards because, even though the Axumite Kingdom welcomed and protected the companions of Muhammad to Ethiopia, who came as refugees to escape the persecution of the ruling families of Mecca and earned the friendship and respect of Muhammad. Their friendship deteriorated when South-Arabians invaded the Dahlak islands through the port of Adulis and destroyed it, which was the economic backbone for the prosperous Aksumite Kingdom. Fearing of what recently occurred, Axum shifted its capital near Agew.[clarification needed]In the middle of the sixteenth centuryAdal Sultanatearmies led byHararleaderAhmed Ibrahiminvaded Habesha lands in what is known as the\"Conquest of Habasha\".[46][47]Following Adal invasions, the southern part of the Empire was lost to Oromo and Muslim state ofHadiyathus scattered Habesha like the Gurage people were cut off from the rest of Abyssinia.[48]In the late sixteenth century the nomadic Oromo people penetrated the Habesha plains occupying large territories during theOromo migrations.[49][50]Abyssinian warlords often competed with each other for dominance of the realm. The Amharas seemed to gain the upper hand with the accession of Yekuno Amlak of Ancient Bete Amhara in 1270, after defeating the Agaw lords of Lasta (in those days a non-Semitic-speaking region of Abyssinia)\n\nThe Gondarian dynasty, which since the 16th century had become the centre of Royal pomp and ceremony of Abyssinia, finally lost its influence as a result of the emergence of powerful regional lords, following the murder ofIyasu I, also known as Iyasu the Great. The decline in the prestige of the dynasty led to the semi-anarchic era ofZemene Mesafint(\"Era of the Princes\"), in which rival warlords fought for power and theYejju Oromoenderases(Amharic:እንደራሴ, \"regents\") had effective control. Theemperorswere considered to be figureheads. Until a young man named Kassa Haile Giorgis also known asEmperor Tewodrosbrought end toZemene Mesafintby defeating all his rivals and took the throne in 1855. The Tigrayans made only a brief return to the throne in the person ofYohannes IVin 1872, whose death in 1889 resulted in the power base shifting back to the dominant Amharic-speaking elite. His successorMenelik IIan Emperor of Amhara origin seized power. Upon Menelik's occupation of theHarar Emirateand other neighboring states, a considerable number of natives were displaced and Abyssinians settled in their place.[51][52][53]InArsi Province, mainly inhabited by theOromo people, their land was appropriated by the Abyssinian colonizers coupled with hefty taxation which led to a revolt in the 1960s.[54]\n\nSome scholars consider the Amhara to have been Ethiopia's ruling elite for centuries, represented by the Solomonic line of Emperors ending inHaile Selassie I. Marcos Lemma and other scholars dispute the accuracy of such a statement, arguing that other ethnic groups have always been active in the country's politics. This confusion may largely stem from the mislabeling of allAmharic-speakersas \"Amhara\", and the fact that many people from other ethnic groups have adopted Amharicnames. Another is the claim that most Ethiopians can trace their ancestry to multiple ethnic groups, including the last self-proclaimed emperorHaile Selassie Iand his Empress ItegeMenen AsfawofAmbassel.[55]\n\nThe Habesha developed an agricultural society, which most continue, including raising ofcamels,donkeys, andsheep. They plow using oxen. The Orthodox Church is an integral part of the culture. The church buildings are built on hills. Major celebrations during the year are held around the church, where people gather from villages all around to sing, play games, and observe the uniquemassof the church. It includes a procession through the church grounds and environs.\n\nCoffeeis a very important ceremonial drink. The \"coffee ceremony\" is common to the Ethiopians and Eritreans. Beans are roasted on the spot, ground, and brewed, served thick and rich in tiny ceramic cups with no handles. This amount of coffee can be finished in one gulp if drunk cold; but, traditionally it is drunk very slowly as conversation takes place. When the beans are roasted to smoking, they are passed around the table, where the smoke becomes a blessing on the diners. The traditional food served at these meals consists ofinjera, a spongy flat bread, served withwat, a spicy meat sauce.\n\nHouses in rural areas are built mostly from rock and dirt, the most available resources, with structure provided by timber poles. The houses blend in easily with the natural surroundings. Many times the nearest water source is more than a kilometer away from the house. In addition, people must search for fuel for their fires throughout the surrounding area.\n\nThe Habesha people have a rich heritage of music and dance, using drums and stringed instruments tuned to apentatonic scale. Arts and crafts and secular music are performed mostly by artisans, who are regarded with suspicion. Sacred music is performed and icons are painted only by men trained in monasteries.\n\nAbyssinians speak languages belonging to theEthiopian Semiticbranch of theAfroasiaticfamily. Among these tongues is the classicalGe'ez language. The kingdom of Dʿmt wrote proto-Ge'ez in Epigraphic South Arabian as early as the 9th century BCE. Later, an independent script replaced it as early as the 5th century BCE.2\n\nGe'ez literature is considered to begin with the adoption ofChristianityin Ethiopia and Eritrea, as well as the civilization of Axum in the 4th century BCE during the reign of Ezana. While Ge'ez today is extinct and only used for liturgical purposes in theEritrean Orthodox Tewahedo ChurchandEthiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. Ge'ez language is ancestral toTigreandTigrinyalanguages.[56]\n\nSome historians in the past have labelled the Ethiopian Semitic languages as theAbyssinian languages.[57]They are mainly spoken by theAmhara, theTigrayans, theTigre, theGurage, theArgobbaand theHararipeople.[58]In antiquityGe'ez-speaking people inhabited theAksumite Empire; the ancient Semitic-speakingGafatinhabited Eastern Damot (East Welega) andWestern Shewa; the Galila clan of Aymallal (Soddo) inhabitedSouthwest Shewa; theZayinhabitedEast Shewa; theHarlawho are the ancestors of Harari lived inSomalia; and the other ancient Argobba and Harari inhabitedShewa,Ifat, andAdal.[59][60][61][62]\n\nThroughout history, various European travelers such asJeronimo Lobo,James BruceandMansfield ParkynsvisitedAbyssinia. Their written accounts about their experiences include observations and descriptions of the Abyssinian customs and manners.\n\nHabesha cuisine characteristically consists of vegetable and often very spicy meat dishes, usually in the form ofwat(alsow'etorwot), a thick stew, served atopinjera, a largesourdoughflatbread,[63]which is about 50 centimeters (20 inches) in diameter and made out of fermentedteffflour.[63]People of Ethiopia and Eritrea eat exclusively with their right hands, using pieces ofinjerato pick up bites of entrées and side dishes.[63]\n\nFit-fit,orfir-fir,is a common breakfast dish. It is made from shreddedinjeraorkitchastir-fried with spices orwat. Another popular breakfast food isfatira.The delicacy consists of a large fried pancake made with flour, often with a layer of egg, eaten with honey.Chechebsa(orkita firfir) resembles apancakecovered withberbereandniter kibbeh, or spices, and may be eaten with a spoon. Aporridge,genfois another common breakfast dish. It is usually served in a large bowl with a dug-out made in the middle of the genfo and filled with spicedniter kibbeh.\n\nWatbegins with a large amount of chopped redonion, which is simmered or sauteed in a pot. Once the onions have softened,niter kebbeh(or, in the case of vegan dishes,vegetable oil) is added. Following this,berbereis added to make a spicykeiy watorkeyyih tsebhi. Turmeric is used instead ofbeberefor a milderalicha wator both are omitted when making vegetable stews,atkilt wat. Meat such asbeef(Amharic:ሥጋ,[64]səga),chicken(Amharic:ዶሮ,[65]doro) orTigrinya:ደርሆ, derho),fish(Amharic:ዓሣ,[66]asa),goatorlamb(Amharic:በግ,[67]begorTigrinya:በጊ, beggi) is also added.Legumessuch assplit peas(Amharic:ክክ,[68]kəkorTigrinya:ኪኪ, kikki) orlentils(Amharic:ምስር,[69]məsərorbirsin); orvegetablessuch aspotatoes(Amharic:ድንች,[70]Dənəch),carrotsandchard(Amharic:ቆስጣ) are also used instead in vegan dishes.\n\nAnother distinctively Habesha dish[citation needed]iskitfo(frequently spelledketfo). It consists of raw (or rare) beef mince marinated inmitmita(Amharic: ሚጥሚጣmīṭmīṭā, a very spicy chili powder similar to theberbere) andniter kibbeh.Gored goredis very similar tokitfo, but uses cubed rather than ground beef. TheEthiopian Orthodox Churchprescribes a number offasting(tsomGe'ez:ጾም,ṣōm) periods, including Wednesdays, Fridays, and the entireLentenseason; so Habesha cuisine contains many dishes that arevegan.[71]\n\nAccording toLeo Africanus, a greater number of the Abyssinians historically woresheephides, with the more honourable wearing the hides oflions,tigersandounces.[72]Duarte Barbosaalso attests that their clothes being of hides as the country was in wanting of clothes.[73]Pedro Paez, aSpanishJesuitwho resided in Ethiopia, described that the peasant women wore skins like their husbands and, in some areas, some woollen cloths five or six cubits long and three wide that they call \"mahâc\", and they could quite fairly call it haircloth because it is much rougher than what Capuchin monks wear, as in Ethiopia they do not know how to make cloth, and the wool is not suitable for it as it is very coarse. They all go barefoot and often naked from the breasts up, with tiny glass beads of various colours strung so as to make a band two fingers in breadth around their necks.[74]\n\nThehabesha kemisis the traditional attire of Habesha women.[75][76]The ankle length dress is usually worn by Ethiopian and Eritrean women at formal events. It is made ofchiffon, and typically comes in white, grey or beige shades. Many women also wrap a shawl called anetelaaround the formal dress.\n\nThenetelaornetselais a handmade cloth manyEthiopianwomen use to cover their head and shoulders when they wear clothing made out ofchiffon, especially when attending church. It is made up of two layers of fabric, unlikegabi, which is made out of four.Kutais the male version.\n\nAnEthiopian or Eritrean suitis the traditionalformal wearof Habesha men.[77]It consists of a long sleeve, knee-length shirt, and matching pants. Most shirts are made with a Mandarin, band, or Nehru collar. The suit is made of chiffon, which is a sheersilkorrayoncloth. Thenetelashawlor akutais wrapped around the suit.\n\nThe Habesha empire centered inAksumandAdwawas part of the world in which Christianity grew. The arrival of Christianity in Northern Ethiopia and Eritrea happened around the 4th century. The Aksumites, in fact, had been converted to Christianity hundreds of years before most of Europe. Many of their churches were cut into cliffs or from single blocks of stone, as they were inTurkeyand in parts ofGreece, where Christianity had existed from its earliest years. The church is a central feature of communities and of each family's daily life. Each community has a church with apatron saint.\n\nEthiopia has often been mentioned in theBible. A well-known example of this is the story of theEthiopian eunuchas written inActs(8: 27): \"Then the angel of the Lord said to Philip, Start out and go south to the road that leads down from Jerusalem to Gaza. So he set out and was on his way when he caught sight of an Ethiopian. This man was a eunuch, a high official of the Kandake (Candace) Queen of Ethiopia in charge of all her treasure.\" The passage continues by describing how Philip helped the Ethiopian understand one passage ofIsaiahthat the Ethiopian was reading. After the Ethiopian received an explanation of the passage, he requested that Philip baptize him, which Philip obliged. QueenGersamot Hendeke VII(very similar to Kandake) was the Queen of Ethiopia from the year 42 to 52. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church was founded in the 4th century bySyrianmonks. Historically, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church have had strong ties with theCoptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria appointing the archbishop for the Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church. They gained independence from theCoptic Orthodox Church of Alexandriain the 1950s, although theEritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Churchhas recently reforged the link.\n\nA number of unique beliefs and practices distinguish Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity from other Christian groups; for example, theArk of the Covenantis very important. Every Ethiopian church has a replica of the Ark. Also, the Ethiopian Church has a larger biblical canon than other churches.\n\nChurch services are conducted in Ge´ez, the ancient language of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Ge´ez is no longer a living language, its use now confined to liturgical contexts, occupying a similar place in Eritrean and Ethiopian church life toLatinin theRoman Catholic Church.\n\nOther Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox practices include such things as fasting, prescribed prayers, and devotion to saints and angels. A child is never left alone until baptism and cleansing rituals are performed. Boys are baptized forty days after birth, whereas girls are baptized eighty days after birth.\n\nDefrocked priests and deacons commonly function as diviners, who are the main healers. Spirit possession is common, affecting primarily women. Women are also the normal spirit mediums. Adebterais anitinerantlay priest figure trained by the Church as ascribe,cantor, and often as a folk healer, who may also function in roles comparable to adeaconorexorcist. Folklore and legends ascribe the role of magician to the debtera as well.\n\nA small number of Abyssinian Christians adhere to various forms ofPentecostalismorAnabaptism, collectively known asP'ent'ay.\n\nThe Ethiopian church places a heavier emphasis on Old Testament teachings than one might find in the Roman Catholic or Protestant churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in Orthodox or ConservativeJudaism.[78]Ethiopian Christians, like some otherEastern Christians, traditionally follow dietary rules that are similar to JewishKashrut, specifically with regard to how an animal is slaughtered. Similarly,porkis prohibited, though unlike Kashrut, Ethiopian cuisine does mixdairyproducts withmeat- which in turn makes it even closer toIslamic dietary laws(seeHalal). Women are prohibited from entering the church during theirmenses; they are also expected to cover their hair with a large scarf (orshash) while in church in keeping with1 Corinthians 11. As with Orthodoxsynagogues, men and women are seated separately in the Ethiopian church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar). However, women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in the Church building officially is common to manyOriental Orthodox,Eastern Orthodoxand Catholic Christians and not unique to Judaism. Ethiopian Orthodox worshippers remove their shoes when entering a church, in accordance withExodus 3:5(in whichMoses, while viewing theburning bush, is commanded to remove his shoes while standing on holy ground). Furthermore, both theSabbath(Saturday), and the Lord's Day (Sunday) are observed as holy, although more emphasis, because of theResurrection of Jesus Christ, is laid upon the Holy Sunday.\n\nIslam in Ethiopia and Eritrea dates to 615. During that year, a group of Muslims were counseled byMuhammadto escape persecution in Mecca andmigrate to Abyssinia, which was ruled by, in Muhammad's estimation, a pious Christian king (al-najashi). Muhammad's followers crossed the Red Sea and sought refuge in the Kingdom of Aksum, possibly settling atNegash, a place in present-day Tigray Region. Moreover, Islamic tradition states thatBilal, one of the foremost companions of Muhammad, was from Abyssinia, as were manynon-Arab Companions of Muhammad; in fact, Abyssinians were the single largest non-Arab ethnic group who were Muhammad's companions. Among these was Umm Ayman who cared for Muhammad during his infancy, a woman that he referred to as \"mother\".[citation needed]Abyssinia was thus the earliest home outside of Arabia for the dispersal of the Islamic world faith. One third (34%) of Ethiopia's population are Muslims by last census (2007).\n\nMost of Ethiopia and Eritrea's Muslims areSunniMuslims, much like the majority of theMuslim world, hence the beliefs and practices of the Muslims of Ethiopia and Eritrea are basically the same: embodied in theQur'anand theSunnah. There are alsoSufiorders present in Ethiopia. According to the 1994 census of Ethiopia (with similar numbers for the 1984 census), about a third of its population is adherent of Islam and members of the Muslim community can be found throughout the country. Islam in Ethiopia is the predominant religion in the regions ofSomali,Afar,Berta, and the section ofOromiaeast of theGreat Rift Valley, as well as inJimma. Islam in Eritrea is the predominant religion of all the ethnic groups except for the Tigrinya people, theBilen people, and theKunama people.[citation needed]\n\nThe most important Islamic religious practices, such as the daily ritual prayers (ṣalāt) and fasting (Arabic:صومṣawm,Ethiopicጾም,ṣom– used by local Christians as well) during the holy month ofRamadan, are observed both in urban centers as well as in rural areas, among both settled peoples and nomads. Numerous Ethiopian Muslims perform the pilgrimage toMeccaevery year.\n\nJudaism in Ethiopia is believed to date from very ancient times. Precisely what its early history was, however, remains obscure. The now dominantEthiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Churchclaims it originated from the visit of the Queen of Sheba to King Solomon back in the 10th century BCE. This visit is mentioned in the Hebrew Scriptures (I Kings 10:1),Shebawas a kingdom that stretched from Ethiopia to the south of the Yemen. Yemen is very close to Ethiopia across the Red Sea, and it has been recorded that modern Ethiopia has been heavily influenced by the ancient Sabean kingdom. Moreover, the details of the queen's visit, including the alleged theft of the Holy Ark as well as Solomon getting her pregnant with a child who established the \"Solomonic\" lineage in Ethiopia, as given in Christian Ethiopian tradition, were written in theKebra Nagastthe Ethiopian chronicle of its early history. The oldest known existing copies of the book date from as far back as the 13th century. Jewish Ethiopians are mentioned in both the TorahOld Testamentas well as the ChristianNew Testament. It is clear that the Jewish presence in Ethiopia dates back at least 2,500 years.\n\nThe Jewish Pre-settlement Theory essentially states that starting around the 8th century BCE until about the 5th century BCE, there was an influx of Jewish settlers both from Egypt & Sudan in the north, and southern Arabia in the east.[citation needed]\n\nThe chief Semitic languages of Ethiopia also suggest an antiquity of Judaism in Ethiopia. \"There still remains the curious circumstance that a number of Abyssinian words connected with religion –Hell,idol,Easter,purification,alms– are of Hebrew origin. These words must have been derived directly from a Jewish source, for the Abyssinian Church knows the scriptures only in a Ge'ez version made from the Septuagint.\"[79]\n\nBeta Israel traditions claim that the Ethiopian Jews are descended from the lineage of Moses himself, some of whose children and relatives are said to have separated from the other Children of Israel after the Exodus and gone southwards, or, alternatively or together with this, that they are descended from the tribe of Dan, which fled southwards down the Arabian coastal lands from Judaea at the time of the breakup of the Kingdom of Israel into two kingdoms in the 10th century BCE. (precipitated by the oppressive demands ofRehoboam, King Solomon's heir), or at the time of the destruction of the northern kingdom of Israel in the 8th century BCE. Certainly there was trade as early as the time of King Solomon down along the Red Sea to the Yemen and even as far as India, according to the Bible, and there would, therefore, have been Jewish settlements at various points along the trade routes. There is definite archaeological evidence of Jewish settlements and of their cultural influence on both sides of the Red Sea well at least 2,500 years ago, both along the Arabian coast and in the Yemen, on the eastern side, and along the southern Egyptian and Sudanese coastal regions. Modern day Ethiopian Jews are adherents ofHaymanot, a sect that is close toKaraite Judaism.\n\nSome Ethiopian Jews, especially thoselivinginIsrael, followmainstream Judaism, mainly due to the Israeli government making 'proper conversion' a prerequisite for being recognized as Jews.\n\n^The source texts, RIE 185 and 189, are unvocalized.

    "title": "[Tapak Tilas] Habasyah, Tempat Hijrah di Awal Dakwah yang Kini Sarat Konflik Berdarah – Muslimah News",
    "content": "Muslimah News\n\nEdukatif, Inspiratif, Mencerdaskan\n\nPenulis: Siti Nafidah Anshory\n\nMuslimahNews, TAPAK TILAS –Siapa tak kenal negeri Habasyah? Sebuah negeri yang terpilih sebagai tempat hijrah pertama para sahabat Rasulullah di awal dakwah. Disebut juga sebagai Abessinia, atau hari ini dikenal dengan nama Etiopia. Negeri ini berjarak cukup jauh dari kota Makkah dan terhalang Laut Merah. Bisa dibayangkan berapa lama dan seberapa sulit para sahabat menempuhnya.\n\nSejak dakwah Rasulullah dan kelompoknya memasuki fase terbuka di tahun keempat kenabian, cukup banyak penduduk Makkah yang tertarik masuk Islam. Namun sejalan dengan itu, hambatan dan gangguan dari para pemuka Quraisy pun makin keras dan kejam. Terutama dialami mereka yang bukan berasal dari suku Quraisy dan tak memiliki pelindungan. Di saat penganiayaan makin menjadi itulah, Rasulullah saw. menyarankan supaya mereka hijrah mencari perlindungan di Habasyah atau Abesinia.\n\nDikisahkan dalam Sirah Ibnu Ishaq, “Setelah Rasulullah Saw. melihat apa yang menimpa para sahabatnya dari siksaan, sementara beliau mendapat perlindungan yang cukup dari Allah, kemudian juga dari pamannya Abu Thalib, dan beliau merasa tidak mampu memberikan perlindungan kepada mereka. Pada saat itulah beliau berkata kepada mereka, ‘Seandainya kalian pergi ke negeri Habasyah karena negeri itu dipimpin oleh seorang raja yang tidak satu pun dari rakyatnya yang terzalimi dan bumi itu adalah bumi yang aman. Tinggallah kalian di sana hingga Allah memberikan jalan keluar kepada kalian dari apa yang menimpa kalian.’”\n\nSetelah itu, sebagian sahabat pun pergi ke Habasyah. Mereka mencari perlindungan demi menghindarkan diri dari peluang kembali murtad akibat beratnya penindasan yang dihadapi. Inilah hijrah pertama dalam Islam. Terjadi pada tahun ke lima sejak bi’tsah kenabian atau tujuh tahun sebelum peristiwa hijrah ke Madinah. Yakni kira-kira tahun 615 M.\n\nMenurut Ibnu Ishaq, gelombang pertama hijrah ke Habsyah ini terdiri atas 11 laki-laki dan 4 perempuan. Di antara mereka adalah Ustman bin ‘Affan ra bersama Ruqayyah putri Rasulullah saw., Abdurrahman bin Auf, Abu Hudzaifah, Utbah bin Rabiah bersama istrinya Sahlah binti Suhail bin Amr, Az-Zubair bin Awwam, Mush’ab bin ‘Umair, Abu Salamah bin Abdul Asad dan istrinya Ummu Salamah binti Abu Umayyah bin Al-Mughirah, Utsman bin Mazh’un (yang memimpin hijrah), serta Amir bin Rabi’ah dan istrinya Laila binti Abi Hatsmah ra.\n\nRombongan pertama ini berangkat dengan mengendap-endap di malam hari, ada yang menggunakan unta dan sebagian berjalan kaki. Mereka berangkat dari Makkah menuju Pelabuhan Shuaybah yang sekarang dikenal sebagai Jeddah. Meski tak aman dari pengejaran orang-orang Quraisy, tetapi akhirnya mereka berhasil keluar dari jazirah dengan menaiki sebuah perahu yang terapung di Pelabuhan Shuaibah. Mereka menyeberangi Laut Merah hingga sampai di Habasyah. Diperkirakan berlabuh di pelabuhan Massawa, tempat Masjid As-Sahaba sekarang berdiri.\n\nPada masa itu di wilayah Habasyah berdiri Kerajaan Aksum yang beragama Kristen yang menguasai wilayah Etiopia dan Eritrea saat ini. Rajanya yang bergelar negus atau نجاشي‎ (najāšī) saat itu bernama Ashama bin Abjar atau dikenal juga sebagai Negus Armah dan Ella Tsaham.\n\nSaat rombongan Muhajirin pertama tiba, Raja Habasyah lalu menempatkan mereka di Negash yang terletak di sebelah utara Provinsi Tigray. Wilayah itu lalu menjadi pusat penyebaran Islam di Habasyah/Abesinia/Etiopia yang masuk dalam bagian Afrika Timur.\n\nBagi penduduk Makkah, negeri Habasyah memang bukanlah tempat yang asing. Mereka telah lama menjalin hubungan dagang. Bahkan tempat ini dipandang sebagai pasar potensial bagi para pebisnis Makkah. Mereka bahkan sangat menyukai negeri itu karena selalu mendapatkan keuntungan yang berlimpah dari produk-produk yang ditawarkannya. Sebaliknya, warga Makkah bagi orang-orang Habasyah pun mempunyai kedudukan istimewa. Mereka memandangnya sebagai “Kekasih Allah” yang selalu mendapatkan perlindungan dari Allah. Salah satu yang mereka kenang adalah selamatnya kota Makkah dari serangan Abrahah karena pertolongan Allah.\n\nTiga bulan setelah kaum muslim tinggal di negeri tersebut dan mendapat perlindungan sangat baik, para sahabat mencoba kembali pulang ke kampung halamannya di Makkah karena mendengar kabar kaum Quraisy sudah melunak. Namun, situasi Makkah ternyata belum aman, bahkan semakin menjadi-jadi.\n\nPascamasuk Islamnya Hamzah dan Umar ra, eskalasi dakwah makin memanas. Kaum muslim dan kabilah pendukungnya justru mengalami pemboikotan. Atas perintah Rasulullah saw. mereka pun kembali ke Habsyah bersama puluhan kaum muslim lainnya. Tercatat jumlah mereka ada 83 laki-laki dan 18 kaum perempuan.\n\nDikarenakan jumlah Muhajirin gelombang kedua ini semakin banyak, orang-orang kafir Quraisy takut jika Islam menjadi besar di Habasyah. Mereka yakin ini bukan sekadar hijrah menyelamatkan diri, akan tetapi hijrah untuk menguatkan dan menyiapkan kaum muslim. Mereka pun berkumpul dan menyepakati pengiriman ahli lobi mereka, yakni Amr bin Ash dan Abdullah bin Abi Rabi’ah. Bersama keduanya dibawakan aneka hadiah untuk diberikan kepada Najasyi dan para pembesar di sekitarnya.\n\nDua orang utusan ini berusaha membujuk Najasyi dan menyampaikan berbagai fitnah keji tentang Muhammad dan ajarannya. Hingga terjadilah dialog sengit antara mereka dengan wakil umat Islam yang dihadirkan dalam persidangan, yakni Ja’far Bin Abi Thalib ra. Namun, dialog itu justru menjadi bumerang bagi utusan Quraisy. Penjelasan Ja’far ra. tentang hakikat ajaran Islam dan Nasrani yang dianut Najasyi, justru membuka pintu hidayah baginya. Maka, dengan tegas Najasyi menolak permintaan utusan tadi, mengusir mereka untuk kembali pada kaumnya. Adapun terhadap kaum muslim, Najasyi memerintahkan agar mereka diberi perlindungan dan penghormatan yang tinggi.\n\nMerujuk pada sejarah, lama waktu kaum muslim di Habasyah ini sulit dipastikan tepatnya. Tapi besar kemungkinan mencapai beberapa tahun. Dikisahkan, beberapa di antara mereka ada yang meninggal di sana. Ada juga yang ikut hijrah bersama Rasulullah Saw. ke Madinah pada 622 M. Sebagian lagi baru kembali setelah penaklukan benteng Khaibar pada 7 H/629 M. Di antaranya adalah Ja’far bin Abu Thalib.\n\nDari tempat pertama mereka berdiam inilah, perlahan namun pasti agama Islam mulai berkembang di Habasyah. Pada mulanya, Islam berkembang di wilayah pesisir selatan Afrika, khususnya dari Somalia. Setelah itu banyak penduduk Habasyah yang memutuskan memeluk agama Islam.\n\nAkan tetapi, perkembangan yang pesat ini tidak berjalan mulus. Umat Nasrani yang berada di wilayah utara Habasyah seperti Amhara dan Oromo justru melakukan upaya perlawanan. Meskipun orang-orang Oromo sehari-hari mempraktikkan tradisi Waaqa yang dipengaruhi budaya Islam, kenyataannya mereka tidak suka Islam berkembang di sana.\n\nSejarawan Ulrich Braukamper berkomentar, “Ekspansi yang dilakukan nonnuslim Oromo yang dilakukan selama berabad-abad di wilayah selatan Etiopia, bertujuan untuk menghapuskan Islam dari kawasan itu.”\n\nNamun, upaya itu tak pernah berhasil. Pada abad ke 16, Khilafah Utsmaniyah melakukan futuhat ke Habasyah melalui Kesultanan Adal dipimpin Iman Ahmad bin Ibrahim al Ghazi seorang pemimpin etnis Somalia. Namun setelah itu, umat Islam mengalami mengalami pasang surut. Sepanjang abad ke-19, mereka hidup dalam tekanan kebijakan kaisar yang memaksa mereka meninggalkan agama Islam dan masuk Kristen. Jika tidak mau, mereka akan diusir.\n\nHabasyah atau Etiopia dikatakan sebagai negara yang cukup unik jika dibandingkan negara-negara Afrika lainnya. Hal ini karena Etiopia tidak pernah dijajah selama Era Perebutan Afrika oleh bangsa Eropa setelah Konferensi Berlin 1885 dan terus merdeka hingga 1936 saat pasukan Italia menguasai negara tersebut. Lalu setelah itu beralih ke tangan Inggris pada 1441 dan mendapatkan kemerdekaan pada 1944.\n\nEtiopia adalah negara dengan jumlah penduduk terbanyak kedua di benua Afrika setelah Nigeria. Sekitar 43,5% penduduk Etiopia adalah pemeluk kepercayaan Ortodok Etiopia dan agama Islam sekitar 33,9%. Etnis mayoritas Etiopia adalah Oromo (34,4%), Amara (27%), Somali (6,2%), dan Tigray (6,1%). Bahasa resmi Etiopia adalah bahasa Amharic (Bahasa resmi Nasional) dan tiga bahasa resmi negara bagian, yaitu bahasa Oromo, bahasa Somali, dan bahasa Tigrigna.\n\nEtiopia juga dikenal sebagai negara yang kerap dilanda bencana kelaparan dan kekeringan luar biasa. Pada 1983-1985 misalnya, telah terjadi peristiwa kelaparan paling brutal yang menewaskan sekitar 400.000 penduduk. Dan pada 2000, Etiopia pernah masuk dalam negara termiskin ketiga di dunia. Kondisi ini telah menjadikan Etiopia rentan intervensi asing lewat jalan bantuan ekonomi.\n\nSejak tahun 2000 itu misalnya, kreditur Cina telah memberikan sejumlah dana sebesar 12,1 miliar dolar AS. Tercatat jumlah total utang negara saat itu mencapai 29 miliar dollar AS. Namun, jumlah ini sebenarnya bukan hanya berasal dari Cina, tetapi juga dari Timur Tengah dan International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nSelain problem ekonomi, Etiopia juga sering dilanda konflik horizontal. Bahkan, baru-baru ini berita menyedihkan datang dari Etiopia, di mana sedikitnya 600 orang warga sipil tewas akibat pembantaian etnis di sana. Tepatnya di Kota May Kadra wilayah Tigray, yang dulu menjadi penampungan kaum Muhajirin pertama.\n\nDiberitakan, Tigray mengalami pertempuran sengit dan terus berlanjut hingga kini. Pihak yang bersengketa adalah pemerintahan federal Etiopia dan mereka yang disebut sebagai kelompok pemberontak Tigray (Front Pembebasan Rakyat Tigray) atau oleh AS disebut-sebut sebagai salah satu kelompok teroris.\n\nBelum ada konfirmasi tentang apa yang sebenarnya dipersengketakan di negeri yang kaya potensi pertanian, gas alam, perak, mangan, emas, bijih besi, tembaga, timah, dan platinum ini. Yang jelas, kedua belah pihak dituduh telah melakukan kekejaman terhadap warga sipil, dengan ribuan orang diyakini telah terbunuh dan ratusan ribu lainnya mengungsi, terutama ke wilayah Sudan.\n\nTidak ada seorang pun yang bisa memprediksi kapan konflik berdarah ini akan berakhir. Namun yang pasti, kemuliaan Etiopia sebagai tempat hijrah pertama ini hanya akan mewujud bersama penerimaan mereka secara mutlak kepada Islam dan kepemimpinan Islam. Kesempatan ini masih terbuka bagi mereka dalam waktu dekat saat Khilafah ala Minhaj an-Nubuwwah kembali tegak.

This is aided by the continuing improvement in realistic image synthesis and manipulation by generative adversarial network, GAN, based methods. The DFFD dataset combines multiple forgery types in a single dataset.\n\nThe DFFD dataset is comprised of multiple publically available datasets and images that are synthesized/manipulated using publically available methods. By incorporating multiple sources for real images, we are able to include varying resolution and image quality for both real and synthetic/manipulated images. More details are in Section 4 ofour paper.\n\nFigure 1: Sample images in the DFFD dataset.\n\nWe split the DFFD dataset into training (50%), validation (5%), and testing (45%) partitions, while taking care to enforce that an identity in one partition does not appear in any other partition.

    "title": "Wahyu: Pengertian, Cara Penyampaian, dan Konsep Wahyu - Universitas Islam An Nur Lampung",
    "content": "DAFTAR ISI:\n\nDikatakanwahaituilaihdanauhaitu, bila kita berbicara kepadanya agar tidak diketahui orang lain. Wahyu adalah isyarat yang cepat.Itu terjadi melalui pembicaran yang berupa rumus dan lambang, dan terkadang melalui suara semata, dan terkadang pula melalui isyarat dengan sebagian anggota badan.\n\nAl-wahyatau wahyu adalah kata masdar; dan materi kata itu menunjukkan dua pengertian dasar, yaitu; tersembunyi dan cepat. Oleh sebab itu maka dikatakan bahwa wahyu adalah: pemberitahuan secara tersembunyi dan cepat dan khusus ditujukan kepada orang yang diberitahu tanpa diketahui orang lain.\n\nSecara istilah wahyu didefinisikan sebagai: kalam Allah yang diturunkan kepada seorang Nabi. Definisi ini menggunakan pengertian maf`ul, yaitual muha(yang diwahyukan).[2]\n\nIbnu Mandzur mendefinisikan, ahyu adalah pemberian informasi yang tersembunyi yang khusus disampaikan kepada para nabi Allah SWT.ma’na al qaththan wahyu adalah kalamullah yang diturunkan kepada Nabi dari para Nabi-Nya.sebagaimana diungkapkan oleh Al-Asfahani, bahwa wahyu adalah ilmu rabbaniy dan bersifat pasti.[3]\n\nUstadz Muhammad Abduh membedakan antara wahyu dengan ilham. Ilham itu intuisi yang diyakini jiwa sehingga terdorong untuk mengikuti apa yang diminta, tanpa mengetahui darimana datangnya. Hal seperti itu serupa dengan rasa lapar, haus sedih dan senang.[4]\n\nCatatan dari al-Qaththan bahwa wahyu itumunazzal; diturunkan langsung, perlu mendapatkan perhatian tersendiri. Karena itu berarti bahwa apa yang diterima Nabi adalah murni sebagai firman Allah Swt secara utuh.  Tidak terkandung didalamnya penafsiran dan pengalihan bahasa oleh malaikat atau oleh Nabi sendiri. Dalam berbagai ayat al-Qur’an penegasan wahyu sebagai tanzil ini dapat ditemukan:\n\n“Al-Qur’an adalah wahyu yang diturunkan dari Tuhan semesta alam. Seandainya dia (Muhammad) mengadakan sebagian perkataan atas (nama) kami, Niscaya benar-benar kami pegang dia pada tangan kanannya (langsung menyiksanya). Kemudian benar-benar kami potong urat tali jantungnya.Maka sekali-sekali tidak ada seorangpun dari kamu yang dapat menghalangi (Kami), dari pemotongan urat nadi itu. (QS. Al-Haqqah: 43-47)\n\n“Dan sesungguhnya al-Qur’an ini benar-benar diturunkan oleh Tuhan semesta alam, dia dibawa turun oleh Ar-Ruh Al-Amin (jibril), kedalam hatimu (Muhammad) agar kamu menjadi salah seorang diantara orrag-orang yang memberi peringatan, dengan bahasa arab yang jelas”. (QS. As-Syu’ara: 192-195)\n\nDalam ayat ini Allah swt dengan sangat tegas menyatakan bahwa al-Qur’an tanzil; diturunkan langsung dalam bahasa arab kedalam sanubari Nabi Muhammad saw. Tidak ada campur tangan malaikat sedikitpun.Termasuk juga Nabi, sebagaimana dinyatakan dalam ayat sebelumnya.\n\nJelas sekali bahwa wahyu yang diturunkan Allah swt kepada para Nabi, termasuk kepada Nabi Muhammad saw, adalah kalam Allah, dan tentunya tidak akan sama dengan hasil kreasi manusia. Dengan sendirinya wahyu ini pun metahistoris; tidak terikat sejarah; tidak terikat oleh ruang dan waktu.\n\nKalau memang wahyu, khususnya al-Qur’an merupakan hasil kreasi manusia tepatnya Nabi Muhammad saw, tentu manusia-manusia yang lainpun akan mampu membuat karya yang serupa dengan al-Qur’an. Akan tetapi fakta berbicara lain, al-qur’an tidak bisa disamai oleh karya manusia yang ada waktu itu, bahkan sampai hari ini.\n\nAllah menentang manusia membuat yang serupa dengan al-Qur’an, mulai dari satu mushaf seperti al-Qur’an, sepuluh surat, bahkan sampai satu surat, akan tetapi sampai hari ini memang tidak ada yang bisa membuatnya. Ini menjadi bukti shahih bahwa al-Quran bukan dihasilkan oleh kreasi manusia yang terikat oleh sejarah itu, melainkan kalam Allah swt yang melintasi sejarah.[5]\n\nAl-Qur’an diturunkan kepada Nabi Muhammad melalui perantaraan Malaikat Jibril selama 22 tahun 2 bulan 22 hari. Dalam proses pewahyuannya, terdapat beberapa cara untuk menyampaikan wahyu yang dibawa Malaikat Jibril kepada Nabi Muhammad, diantaranya:\n\nSecara umum gagasan tentang wahyu muncul pada saat manusia mempunyai gagasan tentang tuhan yang transeden, sehingga diperlukan adanya cara/perantara yang menghubungkan kehidupan manusia yang“real”dengan tuhan yang “transeden”.Maka lahirlah gagasan tentang wahyu.Gagasan tentang wahyu tidak muncul dan mengemukakan pada saat manusia memahami tuhan/dewa sebagai sesuatu yang personal. Karena sebagai tuhan yang personal, tuhan akan bicara kepada manusia selayaknya cara manusia.\n\nSeiring berjalannya waktu,konsep tentang wahyu itu sendiri menjadi sangat bervariasi. Ada yang mengatakan bahwa tuhan bicara secara “verbatim” seperti kisah “bertemunya” Musa dengan tuhan di gunung dan kemudian Musa turun membawa lempengan batu yang berisi “firman tuhan”.\n\nAda pula konsep lain yang mengatakan firman tuhan (wahyu) sampai pada nabi/rasulnya melalui perantara malaikat Jibril, dan wahyu ini tidak disampaikan secara “verbatim” tapi dengan cara yang bevariasi, ada yang berisikan wahyu bisa datang ke Muhammad berupa suara lonceng, yang dengan demikian tugas Muhammad adalah menerjemahkan suara lonceng tadi menjadi sebuah kalimat yang bisa dipahami oleh umatnya.[7]\n\nMemahami konsep wahyu dapat terbagi kedalam dua besaran. Salah satunya makna wahyu alam arti yang lebih luas yakni sebagai proses komunikasi. Dalam pemaknaan demikian wahyu merupakan proses pemberian informasi.\n\nTampaknya tidak berlebihan jika Izutsu kemudian mengupasnya dalam perspektif semantik linguistik untuk memahami konsep ini.Dalam makna inilah (firman) maka wahyu menjadi sakral dan memerlukan penalaran keagamaan untuk memahaminya. Hal ini terjadi, karena dalam suatu dimensi tertentu, wahyu meliputi keseluruhan informasi yang Tuhan berikan kepada manusia.\n\nAkan tetapi dalam Al-Qur’an, wahyu diperlukan sedemikian istimewa, sesuatu yang misterius dan tidak tertangkap oleh pikiran manusia biasa, yang karenanya memerlukan perantara “nabi”. Jadi dalam konteks ini wahyu dalam makna firman tuhan harusnya diterima para nabi untuk kemudian disampaikan kepada umat  manusia. Satu hal yang unik, wahyu dalam islam disampaikan tuhan tidak dengan bahasa yang misterius, bahasa yang berjarak dengan manusia, melainkan dengan bahasa manusia itu sendiri.[8]\n\nKonsep Tentang Sumber Wahyu\n\nKonsep tentang sumber wahyu juga bervariasi.Ada yang mengemukakan gagasan bahwa sumber wahyu itu tunggal (dari tuhan), ada juga yang berpendapat sumber wahyu itu plural[9]. Dari sisi literal tekstual-penggunaan ayat-ayat al-Qur’an yang menegaskan bahwa pewahyuan, turunnya dan penjagaan al-Qur’en menggunakan kata “kami” bukan “saya/aku”-maupun proses kesejarahan al-qur’an sendiri, sumber dan proses al-qur’an memang tidak tunggal, tapi plural: berasal dari “sumber dan proses kreatif-kolektif” yang lebih mengarah pada konteks dimana Nabi Muhammad itu hidup, baik sebelum dia menerima wahyu ataupun setelahnya. Malah, proses kreatif “pewahyuan” itu lebiyh banyak sebelum Mugammad menerima wahyu. Hanya saja, periode Muhammad sebelum menerima wahyu adalah “tahun-tahunyang hilang” ataupun tidak menjadi perhatian.Tujuannya adalah untuk menunjukkanpewahyuan yang tunggal dari tuhan, tidak ada pengaruh konteks dan sejarah terhadap pewahyuan itu.[10]\n\nDeskontruksi Konsep Wahyu\n\nSaat ini konsep wahyu yang sangat jelas dan gamblang sebagaimana diuraikan diatas, didekonstruksi oleh sebagian pihak.Wahyu dinilai bukan kalam Allah, melainkan teks yang dibuat oleh sejarah.Maka hermeneutika pun menjadi satu-satunya model penafsiran yang tepat untuk al-Qur’an.\n\nMenurut komaruddin, al-Qur’an haruslah dilihat dari persefektif teologi filsafat linguistik.Sebuah pandangan teologis menyebutkan al-Qur’an adalah suci, kebenarannya absolut, berlaku dimana dan kapan saja.Sehingga dia tidak bisa dirubah dan diterjemahkan. Begitu diterjemahkan dna ditafsirkan, maka ia bukan lagi al-Qur’an, melainkan terjemahan dan tafsiran al-Qur’an.\n\nKomaruddin juga menjelaskan, wahyu itu pada dasarnya bukanlah bahasa tertulis.Wujud wahyu adalah “suara” atau “bisikan”. Proses kalam Allah yang abadi, universal dan metahistoris tersebut menjadi bahasa arab yang bersifat budaya, berdimensi lokal dan partikular merupakan sebuah hal yang selalu memancing nalar kritis.\n\nKomaruddin juga menjelaskan lebih lanjut, dalam al-qur’an yang telah tersaji saat ini, setidaknya telah melalui dua proses penafsiran, yaitu:\n\nDekonstruksi yang dilakukan dikalangan liberal tertuju pada dua hal, yaitu:\n\n[1] Desakralisasi adalah penghapusan atau pelenyapan nilai yang dianggap keramat (sakral)\n\n[2]http://alfarabi1706.blogspot.com/2012/10/konsep-wahyu.html\n\n[3]http://.google.com/gt/x?=id&u=http://iraanmalik.blogspot.com/2013/05/konsep-wahyu.html&q=konsep+wahyu&sa=X&ei=DRmKoW8MlaRrAeOhoDADw&ved=OCCsQFjAEOBQ/2013/11/19/11:39\n\n[4]http://alfarabi1706.blogspot.com/2012/10/konsep-wahyu.html\n\n[5] Nashruddin syarief, Menangkal Virus Islam Liberal, 2010, hal  148-153\n\n[6]ahmadbudi2991.blogspot.com/2012/03/konsep-wahyu.html\n\n[7]http://ww.google.com/gwt/x?hl=id&u=http:/qiemo.tumblr.com/post/875683055/konsep-tentang wahyu&q=konsep+wahyu&sa=X&ei=TeGJUuayJYaCrAegilGIA&ed=OCCoQFjAC/2013/11/18/17:41\n\n[8] http://w.google.com/gt/x?hl=id&u=http://bdkbandung.kemenag.go.id/jurnal/117-tinjauan-islam-tentang-konsep-wahyu-dan-pewarisan-amanat-keagungan-ilahi&q=konsep+wahyu&sa=X&ei=ufOJUtGfL8v9rAfltlG4BQ&ved=OCCgFjABOAo/2013/11/19/11:25\n\n[9] Plural adalah lebih dari satu, jamak\n\n[10]http://ww.google.com/gwt/x?hl=id&u=http:/qiemo.tumblr.com/post/875683055/konsep-tentangwahyu&q=konsep+wahyu&sa=X&ei=TeGJUuayJYaCrAegilGIA&ed=OCCoQFjAC/2013/11/18/17:41\n\n[11] Nashiruddin Syarief,Menangkal Virus Islam Liberal (Panduan Worldvie Untuk Para Aktivis Da’wah).
